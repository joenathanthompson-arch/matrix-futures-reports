### Assessment:
Mixed signals with PMI data showing divergence, but GDP growth forecasts are STABLE around 4.5-4.8% for 2026, slightly down from 5% in 2025.

According to methodology:
- Accelerating: +1
- **Stable: 0** ← CURRENT (4.5-4.8% vs 5.0% prior year = modest slowdown but stable)
- Slowing: -1

**China Growth Score: 0 (Stable)**

Note: While there is a slight deceleration from 5% to 4.5%, this is still considered stable growth in the 4.5-5% range. The IMF even upgraded its forecast by 0.3pp. PMI data is mixed but not showing dramatic deterioration.

### Interpretation for 6A (AUD):
