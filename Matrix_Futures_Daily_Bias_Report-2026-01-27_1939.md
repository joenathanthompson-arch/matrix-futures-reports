## Asset Class Bias

- **Commodities:** BULLISH
- **Indices:** STRONG_BULLISH
- **FX:** STRONG_BULLISH

## Key Macro Drivers

1.  **Falling Real Yields:** The primary driver across markets today is the significant drop in 10-year real yields (TIPS), which are now at 1.89%. This provides a powerful tailwind for non-yielding assets like **Gold (GC)** and long-duration growth assets like the **Nasdaq 100 (NQ)**.
2.  **Broad U.S. Dollar Weakness:** The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is down a sharp 1.28% to 95.818. This weakness is a broad-based positive factor for commodities and foreign currencies, providing a direct lift to **Gold (GC)**, **Silver (SI)**, **Euro (M6E)**, **Aussie (6A)**, and **Yen (6J)**.
3.  **Central Bank Divergence:** While the Federal Reserve maintains a neutral stance, both the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) are exhibiting a clear hawkish tilt. The market is increasingly pricing in a rate hike from the RBA, and the BoJ is continuing its policy normalization. This divergence is creating strong bullish cases for the **Australian Dollar (6A)** and the **Japanese Yen (6J)**.

## Data Quality & Notes

- **Stale Data:** The FRED data for 10-Year TIPS (DFII10) was one day stale. Real-time data from CNBC was used as a fallback to confirm the direction and magnitude of the move in real yields.
- **Confidence Scores:** Confidence is assigned on a 1-10 scale based on the clarity, strength, and confluence of the underlying macro factors. Higher scores indicate a more robust and reliable signal.
