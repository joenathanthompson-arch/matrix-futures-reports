# Macro Bias Scorer - Daily Report (Corrected)

**Generated:** 2026-01-26 15:08 UTC

## Overall Market Bias: Neutral to Slightly Bearish

The corrected macro analysis now indicates a **neutral to slightly bearish** bias for risk assets. The initial assessment was flawed due to an incorrect application of the scoring methodology. The primary driver of this revised outlook is the significant negative impact of **rising real yields**, which carries a heavy weight in the scoring for most instruments. While some positive factors remain, such as a dovish Fed and narrowing credit spreads, they are not enough to offset the drag from higher yields.

## Instrument Bias Scores (Corrected)

### GC (Gold): NEUTRAL

| Metric                | Value      |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| **Weighted Bias Score** | **-1**     |
| **Bias Interpretation** | **NEUTRAL**  |

**Component Breakdown:**

| Indicator          | Contribution |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| real_yields        | -4           |
| fed_stance         | +1           |
| dxy                | +1           |
| risk_mood          | +1           |
| growth_narrative   | -1           |
| gold_etf_flows     | +1           |
| oil_supply_shock   | +0           |

**Analysis:** Gold's bias is now **Neutral**. The strong negative pressure from a 2-point rise in real yields (weighted at 2x) is the dominant factor, offsetting the bullish inputs from a dovish Fed, a weaker dollar, and positive ETF flows.

### SI (Silver): SLIGHT BULLISH

| Metric                | Value      |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| **Weighted Bias Score** | **+2**     |
| **Bias Interpretation** | **SLIGHT BULLISH** |

**Component Breakdown:**

| Indicator          | Contribution |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| real_yields        | -2           |
| fed_stance         | +1           |
| dxy                | +1           |
| risk_mood          | +1           |
| growth_narrative   | -1           |
| copper             | +1           |
| gold_etf_flows     | +1           |

**Analysis:** Silver maintains a **Slightly Bullish** bias. While still impacted by rising real yields, the negative effect is less pronounced (1x weight). This allows the positive contributions from industrial demand (copper) and precious metals sentiment (gold flows) to give it a slight edge.

### ES (S&P 500) & NQ (Nasdaq): NEUTRAL

| Metric                | ES / NQ    |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| **Weighted Bias Score** | **+0**     |
| **Bias Interpretation** | **NEUTRAL**  |

**Analysis:** The major equity indices are now rated **Neutral**. Similar to gold, the heavily weighted (2x) negative impact of rising real yields completely neutralizes the combined positive effects of a dovish Fed, low volatility, and narrowing credit spreads.

### YM (Dow): SLIGHT BULLISH

| Metric                | Value      |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| **Weighted Bias Score** | **+1**     |
| **Bias Interpretation** | **SLIGHT BULLISH** |

**Analysis:** The Dow Jones Industrial Average shows a **Slightly Bullish** bias. Its scoring is less sensitive to real yields (1x weight) and gives a heavier weight (2x) to the positive growth narrative, allowing it to maintain a slight positive score.

### CL (Crude Oil): SLIGHT BEARISH

| Metric                | Value      |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| **Weighted Bias Score** | **-2**     |
| **Bias Interpretation** | **SLIGHT BEARISH** |

**Component Breakdown:**

| Indicator          | Contribution |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| growth_narrative   | -2           |
| inventories        | -1           |
| dxy                | +1           |
| oil_supply_shock   | +0           |
| geopolitical_risk  | +0           |

**Analysis:** Crude oil now has a **Slightly Bearish** bias. The negative impact of a strong growth narrative (which implies less need for stimulus and potentially higher rates) combined with a build in inventories outweighs the positive impact of a weaker dollar.
