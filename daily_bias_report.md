# Macro Bias Scorer - Daily Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-26 14:32 UTC

## Overall Market Bias: Strongly Bullish

The current macro environment exhibits a **strongly bullish** bias for risk assets, particularly equities. This is driven by a confluence of positive factors including a dovish Federal Reserve stance, declining market volatility (VIX and MOVE), robust economic growth signals (GDPNow), and tightening credit spreads. While rising real yields and a weaker dollar present some headwinds, the overwhelming weight of the evidence points towards continued market strength. Gold and Silver show strong bullish signals, while Crude Oil maintains a bullish outlook.

| **Bias Interpretation** | **STRONG BULLISH** |

| ------------------ | ------------ |
| fed_stance         | +0.200       |
| real_yields        | -0.200       |
| dxy                | -0.150       |
| gold_etf_flows     | +0.150       |

| move               | +0.050       |

**Analysis:** Gold's strong bullish bias is primarily supported by a dovish Fed and significant inflows into Gold ETFs. These factors are currently outweighing the negative impact of rising real yields and a weaker dollar.

### SI (Silver): STRONG BULLISH

| Metric                | Value      |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| **Weighted Bias Score** | **+0.500** |
| **Bias Interpretation** | **STRONG BULLISH** |

**Component Breakdown:**

| Indicator          | Contribution |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| fed_stance         | +0.150       |
| real_yields        | -0.150       |
| gold_etf_flows     | +0.150       |
| sox                | +0.150       |

| gdpnow             | +0.050       |
| credit_spreads     | +0.050       |

**Analysis:** Silver's bias is even more bullish than gold's, benefiting from the same macro tailwinds, plus strong industrial demand signals from the semiconductor (SOX) and copper markets.

### ES (S&P 500), NQ (Nasdaq), YM (Dow): STRONG BULLISH

| Metric                | ES         | NQ         | YM         |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Weighted Bias Score** | **+0.700** | **+0.700** | **+0.700** |
| **Bias Interpretation** | **STRONG BULLISH** | **STRONG BULLISH** | **STRONG BULLISH** |

**Analysis:** The major equity indices share a uniformly strong bullish outlook. The combination of low volatility, a dovish Fed, strong economic growth, and positive signals from the credit and semiconductor markets creates a powerful tailwind for stocks.

### CL (Crude Oil): BULLISH

| Metric                | Value      |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| **Weighted Bias Score** | **+0.100** |
| **Bias Interpretation** | **BULLISH**  |

**Component Breakdown:**

| Indicator          | Contribution |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| gdpnow             | +0.200       |
| dxy                | -0.150       |
| oil_inventories    | -0.150       |
| fed_stance         | +0.100       |
| vix                | +0.100       |
| real_yields        | -0.050       |
| credit_spreads     | +0.050       |
| oil_supply_shock   | +0.000       |

**Analysis:** Crude oil's bullish bias is supported by strong economic growth expectations. However, the recent build in inventories and a weaker dollar are acting as counterweights, resulting in a more moderate bullish signal compared to equities and precious metals.
