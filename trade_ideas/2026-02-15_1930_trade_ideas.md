# Matrix Futures Trade Ideas

**Date:** 2026-02-15  
**Time:** 19:30 EST (00:30 UTC)  
**Market Regime:** Risk-On with Strong Bullish Bias

---

## High Conviction Trades (Score ≥ +7)

### 1. ES (S&P 500) - LONG | Score: +9 | Confidence: 8/10

**Setup:**
- Entry: Above 6,830
- Target: 6,900-6,950
- Stop Loss: Below 6,800
- Risk/Reward: ~1:2.5

**Thesis:** Strongest bullish score in the report. Falling real yields (2x weight) create exceptional tailwind for equities. The combination of dovish Fed (3.50-3.75% hold), narrowing credit spreads (HY OAS at 2.92%, down from 3.2%), and falling VIX (20.60) signals strong risk-on sentiment. Stable growth (GDPNow 3.7%) with dovish Fed is the Goldilocks scenario for equities.

**Catalysts:**
- Real yields falling below 1.9% (currently 1.89%)
- Credit spreads continuing to narrow
- Fed maintaining dovish stance into March FOMC

**Risk Management:** If VIX spikes above 23 or real yields reverse above 2.0%, consider taking profits or tightening stops.

**Time Horizon:** 3-7 trading sessions (signal decay consideration)

### 2. RTY (Russell 2000) - LONG | Score: +8 | Confidence: 8/10

**Setup:**
- Entry: Above 2,640
- Target: 2,700
- Stop Loss: Below 2,620
- Risk/Reward: ~1:3

**Thesis:** Small caps are the primary beneficiary of improving credit conditions. Narrowing credit spreads (2x weight in scoring) and steepening yield curve (2s10s at 0.64%) create ideal environment for small-cap outperformance. RTY is most sensitive to credit access among major indices. Dovish Fed reduces refinancing risk for smaller companies.

**Catalysts:**
- Credit spreads narrowing further below 2.8%
- Yield curve steepening above 0.70%
- Small-cap earnings surprises

**Risk Management:** Small caps are volatile. Use wider stops. Monitor credit spreads daily - widening above 3.1% would be warning sign.

**Time Horizon:** 5-10 trading sessions

### 3. GC (Gold) - LONG | Score: +8 | Confidence: 8/10

**Setup:**
- Entry: Above $2,930
- Target: $3,000+
- Stop Loss: Below $2,900
- Risk/Reward: ~1:2+

**Thesis:** Gold receiving exceptional support from falling real yields (2x weight), weak USD (DXY 96.88), and record gold ETF inflows ($19bn in January 2026 - strongest month on record). Rising geopolitical tensions (US-China, Middle East) add safe-haven bid. Real yields below 1.9% are historically very bullish for gold.

**Catalysts:**
- Real yields falling toward 1.7%
- Gold ETF inflows continuing in February
- Geopolitical tensions escalating
- Fed signaling more dovish pivot

**Risk Management:** If real yields spike above 2.1% or USD strengthens sharply (DXY > 98), consider profit-taking.

**Time Horizon:** 1-2 weeks (potential for longer-term hold if catalysts persist)

---

### 4. NQ (NASDAQ) - LONG | Score: +7 | Confidence: 7/10

**Setup:**
- Entry: Above 24,700
- Target: 25,000
- Stop Loss: Below 24,500
- Risk/Reward: ~1:1.5

**Thesis:** Tech sector benefits from falling real yields and rising semiconductor strength (SOX +59.95% YoY, +5.84% 1M). Tech-heavy NASDAQ well-positioned in current environment. Rising MOVE index (bond volatility at 70.10) is minor concern but outweighed by positive factors.

**Catalysts:**
- SOX continuing to make new highs
- Real yields staying below 2.0%
- Big tech earnings beats

**Risk Management:** Monitor MOVE index - if it spikes above 80, tech volatility could increase. Rising rate volatility is headwind for growth stocks.

**Time Horizon:** 3-5 trading sessions

---

### 5. YM (Dow Jones) - LONG | Score: +7 | Confidence: 7/10

**Setup:**
- Entry: Above 49,450
- Target: 49,750
- Stop Loss: Below 49,200
- Risk/Reward: ~1:1.2

**Thesis:** Broad-based bullish factors support Dow. Steepening yield curve (2s10s at 0.64%) is particularly positive for financials and cyclicals that dominate Dow. Narrowing credit spreads benefit value-oriented Dow components. More defensive than NQ but solid upside.

**Catalysts:**
- Yield curve steepening further
- Financial sector strength
- Value rotation continuing

**Risk Management:** Dow is less volatile than NQ/RTY. Tighter stops appropriate. Watch for yield curve flattening.

**Time Horizon:** 5-7 trading sessions

---

### 6. SI (Silver) - LONG | Score: +7 | Confidence: 7/10

**Setup:**
- Entry: Above $32.50
- Target: $34.00
- Stop Loss: Below $32.00
- Risk/Reward: ~1:3

**Thesis:** Silver follows gold's strength while benefiting from industrial demand signals (copper +24% YoY). Dual nature of silver as both precious and industrial metal makes it attractive. Gold/silver ratio may compress as silver catches up to gold's rally.

**Catalysts:**
- Gold continuing to rally toward $3,000
- Industrial demand data improving
- Copper maintaining strength

**Risk Management:** Silver is more volatile than gold. Use position sizing accordingly. If gold reverses, silver will likely fall harder.

**Time Horizon:** 1-2 weeks

---

## Moderate Conviction Trades (Score +3 to +6)

### 7. 6A (Australian Dollar) - LONG | Score: +5 | Confidence: 6/10

**Setup:**
- Entry: Above 0.6400
- Target: 0.6500
- Stop Loss: Below 0.6350
- Risk/Reward: ~1:2

**Thesis:** AUD as commodity currency benefits from weak USD (DXY 96.88) and rising copper prices (+24.41% YoY). Risk-on sentiment (2x weight) is key driver for AUD. Stable China growth (inferred from copper strength) provides baseline support.

**Catalysts:**
- USD continuing to weaken
- Copper breaking above $6.00/lb
- China stimulus announcements
- RBA maintaining hawkish stance

**Risk Management:** AUD is sensitive to China data and risk sentiment. If VIX spikes or China data disappoints, exit quickly.

**Time Horizon:** 5-10 trading sessions

---

## Low Conviction / Neutral Trades (Score -2 to +2)

### 8. M6E (Euro) - SLIGHT LONG | Score: +1 | Confidence: 5/10

**Setup:**
- Range-bound trading
- Support: 1.0400-1.0450
- Resistance: 1.0550-1.0600

**Thesis:** Weak USD provides tailwind for EUR, but negative rate differential (Fed 3.50-3.75% vs ECB lower) limits upside. ECB maintaining neutral stance while Fed is dovish narrows differential slightly but not enough for strong EUR rally. Expect range-bound trading.

**Catalysts:**
- ECB turning more hawkish
- USD weakness accelerating
- Eurozone data surprising to upside

**Risk Management:** Use tight stops in range. Not a high-conviction trade.

**Time Horizon:** Short-term (1-3 sessions)

---

### 9. CL (Crude Oil) - NEUTRAL TO SLIGHT LONG | Score: +1 | Confidence: 5/10

**Setup:**
- Watch for entry signals
- Key level: $64-65
- Monitor inventory data

**Thesis:** Mixed signals for crude. The 8.5 million barrel inventory build (week ending Feb 6) is bearish, but rising geopolitical tensions (US-China, Middle East) and weak USD provide support. Neutral growth outlook limits upside. Wait for inventory draws before committing.

**Catalysts:**
- Next EIA report showing inventory draw
- Geopolitical tensions escalating
- OPEC+ production cuts

**Risk Management:** Do not force this trade. Wait for clearer signal from inventory data (next report Feb 19).

**Time Horizon:** Wait for next EIA report

---

### 10. 6J (Japanese Yen) - NEUTRAL | Score: -1 | Confidence: 5/10

**Setup:**
- No trade recommended
- Wait for BoJ policy clarity

**Thesis:** Mixed signals for JPY. BoJ maintaining ultra-loose policy (2x weight) is major headwind. Wide rate differential (Fed 3.50-3.75% vs BoJ near 0%) favors USD over JPY. However, weak USD and elevated geopolitical risk provide some safe-haven support. Net result is neutral.

**Catalysts:**
- BoJ policy shift signals
- Major risk-off event
- USD/JPY technical breakdown

**Risk Management:** Stay on sidelines until BoJ provides clearer policy direction.

**Time Horizon:** N/A (no trade)
