Next FOMC Meeting: March 18-19, 2026 (35 days away)

Current Probabilities:

- 350-375 bps: 71.3%
- 325-350 bps: 27.6%
- 300-325 bps: 1.1%

=== GEOPOLITICAL RISK ===
Source: Multiple news sources, World Economic Forum, CFR
Date: February 2026

=== ECB STANCE (for M6E Euro) ===
Source: European Central Bank
Date: February 5, 2026

Latest Decision:
- ECB kept three key interest rates UNCHANGED
- Deposit rate: 2.00% (unchanged since June 2025)
- Main refinancing rate: 2.15%
- Marginal lending facility: 2.40%
- Eurozone inflation: 1.7% (below 2% target)
- ECB on hold since ending rate cuts spree in June 2025
- Expected to keep rates steady through 2026

Analysis: ECB is in a NEUTRAL HOLD stance. Rates have been unchanged since June 2025 after completing a cutting cycle. With inflation at 1.7% (below target), the ECB is neither hawkish nor dovish - just maintaining current policy. This is similar to the Fed's stance.

ECB Stance Score: 0 (Neutral hold)


=== RBA STANCE (for 6A Australian Dollar) ===
Source: Reserve Bank of Australia
Date: February 3, 2026

Latest Decision:
- RBA INCREASED cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%
- First rate hike since 2023
- Unanimous decision
- Shift from easing in 2025 to tightening in 2026
- Headline inflation forecast at 4.2% by mid-2026 (above target)
- RBA expects to do "whatever it takes" to lower inflation
- Market expects potential for additional rate hikes in 2026

Analysis: RBA has taken a HAWKISH HIKE stance. This is the first rate increase since 2023, marking a clear policy shift from easing to tightening. With inflation running hot at 4.2% forecast, the RBA is actively tightening monetary policy.

RBA Stance Score: +2 (Hawkish hike - using the Fed scale, this would be a hike)

Note: For scoring purposes, using Fed stance scale: Hawkish hike = -2 for gold/commodities (tightening is bearish), but for AUD itself, a hawkish RBA relative to Fed is BULLISH for AUD.


=== BOJ STANCE (for 6J Japanese Yen) ===
Source: Bank of Japan
Date: January 23, 2026

Latest Decision:
- BoJ kept key short-term interest rate UNCHANGED at 0.75%
- Rate was last raised in December 2025 from 0.5% to 0.75%
- Highest level in about 30 years
- BoJ policymaker calls for "timely rate hike" to manage inflation (Feb 6)
- Economic growth forecast upgraded to 1.0% for fiscal 2026
- Inflation outlook also raised
- Market expects further gradual rate hikes

Analysis: BoJ is in a GRADUAL TIGHTENING stance. While rates were held steady in January, the December 2025 hike to 0.75% and policymaker comments calling for "timely rate hikes" indicate a hawkish tilt. The BoJ is normalizing policy but at a very gradual pace.

BoJ Stance Score: +1 (Hawkish tilt - gradual normalization)
