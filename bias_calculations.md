### 6A (AUD/USD)

**Applicable Factors:**
- Fed Stance: 0 × 2.5 = 0.0
- RBA Stance: -2 × 2.5 = -5.0 (hawkish hike = bullish AUD, but inverted for 6A)
- DXY: 0 × 2.0 = 0.0
- China Growth: 0 × 2.0 = 0.0 (stable)
- Copper: +1 × 1.5 = +1.5 (commodity correlation)

**Total Weight:** 10.5
**Raw Score:** -3.5
**Bias Score:** -3.5 / 10.5 × 10 = **-3.33** → **-3**

Wait, need to reconsider the RBA stance interpretation. RBA hawkish hike should be BULLISH for AUD.
Let me recalculate:

**Corrected:**
- RBA Stance: -2 (hawkish) → For 6A, hawkish RBA = bullish AUD = POSITIVE for 6A
- So: -2 × -2.5 = +5.0 (double negative because RBA hawkish is bullish for AUD)

Actually, let me use the methodology correctly:
- RBA score is -2 (hawkish hike)
- For AUD: Hawkish RBA = Bullish AUD
- So we apply the score directly with positive weight: -2 × 2.5 = -5.0
- But this means bearish for 6A...

Let me reconsider the framework. The RBA score of -2 represents "hawkish hike" which is BULLISH for AUD.
For 6A (AUD/USD), a bullish AUD means 6A goes UP.
So the -2 score should translate to BULLISH for 6A.

I'll invert the sign: RBA -2 (hawkish) = +2 for 6A calculation
- RBA Stance: +2 × 2.5 = +5.0

**Recalculated:**
- Fed Stance: 0 × 2.5 = 0.0
- RBA Stance: +2 × 2.5 = +5.0 (inverted: RBA hawkish = bullish AUD)
- DXY: 0 × 2.0 = 0.0
- China Growth: 0 × 2.0 = 0.0
- Copper: +1 × 1.5 = +1.5

**Total Weight:** 10.5
**Raw Score:** +6.5
**Bias Score:** +6.5 / 10.5 × 10 = **+6.19** → **+6**

**Bias: BULLISH (+6)**

### 6J (JPY/USD - Inverted)

Note: 6J is inverted - when JPY strengthens vs USD, 6J goes UP.
BoJ hawkish/tightening = JPY strengthens = 6J UP = BULLISH 6J

**Applicable Factors:**
- Fed Stance: 0 × 2.5 = 0.0
- BoJ Stance: +1 × 2.5 = +2.5 (hawkish BoJ = bullish JPY = bullish 6J)
- DXY: 0 × 2.0 = 0.0
- VIX: 0 × 1.5 = 0.0 (safe haven correlation)
- Geopolitical Risk: +1 × 1.0 = +1.0 (safe haven demand)

**Total Weight:** 9.5
**Raw Score:** +3.5
**Bias Score:** +3.5 / 9.5 × 10 = **+3.68** → **+4**

**Bias: BULLISH (+4)**
