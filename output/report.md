### Asset Class Bias

*   **Commodities:** **BULLISH**. Broad-based strength is driven by a weaker US Dollar, strong ETF inflows into precious metals, and a significant draw in crude oil inventories. Silver shows particular strength, benefiting from both its precious metal and industrial characteristics.
*   **Indices:** **BULLISH**. The outlook for equity indices is positive across the board. A risk-on environment is supported by falling VIX, narrowing credit spreads, and a steepening yield curve. The Nasdaq 100 is further bolstered by a strong semiconductor sector (SOX) and falling interest rate volatility (MOVE).
*   **FX:** **BULLISH**. The bias is bullish against the US Dollar. The primary driver is the pronounced weakness in the DXY index. The Japanese Yen (6J) exhibits the strongest bullish signal due to the Bank of Japan's ongoing policy normalization, which contrasts with the Federal Reserve's neutral stance, creating a widening rate differential.

### Key Drivers & Market Narrative

The market narrative for today is one of **risk-on sentiment**, underpinned by three primary macroeconomic drivers:

1.  **Broad US Dollar Weakness:** The DXY has shown significant decline over multiple timeframes, providing a tailwind for all non-USD denominated assets, including commodities, foreign currencies, and to some extent, US equities.
2.  **Accommodative Financial Conditions:** Credit spreads continue to narrow, and both equity (VIX) and rates (MOVE) volatility are declining. This combination signals calm and stability in financial markets, encouraging investment in riskier assets like equities.
3.  **Divergent Central Bank Policies:** The Bank of Japan's move towards policy normalization stands in contrast to the neutral-hold stance of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. This divergence is the primary catalyst for the strong bullish signal in the Japanese Yen.

### Methodology and Scoring

The bias scores are calculated using a proprietary weighted model that analyzes over 14 macroeconomic variables. Each variable is assigned a raw score (+1, 0, or -1) based on its current state and trend, which is then multiplied by its assigned weight to arrive at a final weighted score for each instrument. The sum of these weighted scores determines the final Bias Score and corresponding Signal.

*   **Score > +5:** STRONG_BULLISH
*   **Score +3 to +4:** BULLISH
*   **Score +1 to +2:** SLIGHT_BULLISH
*   **Score 0:** NEUTRAL
*   **Score -1 to -2:** SLIGHT_BEARISH
*   **Score -3 to -4:** BEARISH
*   **Score < -5:** STRONG_BEARISH
