## Instrument Analysis & Strategy

### GC - Gold Futures

**Bias Score:** +2 | **Bias:** Mildly Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Weak USD and risk-off sentiment (VIX >20) provide support for gold. Fed neutral stance and flat real yields limit upside. Geopolitical tensions (US-Iran) add safe-haven bid.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Look for dips toward $2,650-2,660 support for long entries
- **Target:** $2,700-2,720 resistance zone
- **Stop Loss:** Below $2,640 (daily close)
- **Risk Management:** Use 1-2% account risk per trade. Consider scaling in on pullbacks.
- **Time Horizon:** 3-5 trading sessions

---

### SI - Silver Futures

**Bias Score:** +3 | **Bias:** Moderately Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Silver benefits from weak USD, risk-off mood, and rising copper (industrial demand proxy). Stronger than gold due to copper correlation. Limited by flat growth outlook.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Long on pullbacks to $31.50-32.00 support
- **Target:** $33.50-34.00 resistance
- **Stop Loss:** Below $31.00 (daily close)
- **Risk Management:** Silver is more volatile than gold; reduce position size by 30-40% vs gold trades.
- **Time Horizon:** 3-5 trading sessions

---

### CL - Crude Oil Futures

**Bias Score:** +1 | **Bias:** Mildly Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Geopolitical risk (US-Iran tensions) supports oil, but inventory build (-1) and weak USD offset. Neutral growth outlook limits demand expectations.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Long above $73.50 with confirmation
- **Target:** $76.00-77.00
- **Stop Loss:** Below $72.00
- **Risk Management:** Oil is headline-sensitive; use tight stops and monitor geopolitical news closely.
- **Time Horizon:** 2-4 trading sessions

---

### ES - S&P 500 E-mini Futures

**Bias Score:** +4 | **Bias:** Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Strong score driven by narrowing credit spreads (+1), weak USD, and risk-off paradox (VIX rising but equities resilient). Fed neutral and flat yields supportive. Broad market strength.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Long on dips to 6,800-6,820 support
- **Target:** 6,900-6,950 (new highs possible)
- **Stop Loss:** Below 6,750
- **Risk Management:** ES is liquid; use standard 1-2% risk. Watch for VIX spikes above 25 as exit signal.
- **Time Horizon:** 5-7 trading sessions

---

### NQ - Nasdaq 100 E-mini Futures

**Bias Score:** +2 | **Bias:** Mildly Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Weak USD and risk-off mood support, but rising MOVE index (-1, rate volatility) pressures tech. SOX rising (+1) is bullish for semis. Lower than ES due to rate sensitivity.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Long above 24,500 with SOX confirmation
- **Target:** 25,200-25,500
- **Stop Loss:** Below 24,000
- **Risk Management:** NQ is volatile; reduce size by 20% vs ES. Monitor 10Y yields and MOVE index.
- **Time Horizon:** 3-5 trading sessions

---

### YM - Dow Jones E-mini Futures

**Bias Score:** +4 | **Bias:** Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Strong score from steepening yield curve (+1), narrowing credit spreads, weak USD, and risk-off resilience. Value/cyclical tilt benefits from curve steepening.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Long on pullbacks to 49,200-49,400
- **Target:** 50,000-50,200 (psychological resistance)
- **Stop Loss:** Below 48,800
- **Risk Management:** YM less volatile than NQ; can use slightly larger position size. Watch financials sector.
- **Time Horizon:** 5-7 trading sessions

---

### RTY - Russell 2000 E-mini Futures

**Bias Score:** +4 | **Bias:** Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Strongest equity bias alongside ES/YM. Narrow credit spreads (2x weight, +2) and steepening curve (+1) highly bullish for small caps. Risk-off mood offset by credit strength.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Long above 2,600 with volume confirmation
- **Target:** 2,680-2,720
- **Stop Loss:** Below 2,550
- **Risk Management:** RTY is highly volatile; reduce position size by 30-40% vs ES. Requires strong risk appetite.
- **Time Horizon:** 5-7 trading sessions

---

### 6E - Euro FX Futures

**Bias Score:** +2 | **Bias:** Mildly Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Weak USD (+1) and risk-off mood (+1) support EUR. ECB neutral hold (0) and flat rate differential (0) limit upside. Eurozone growth data missing but assumed stable.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Long above 1.0420-1.0440
- **Target:** 1.0550-1.0600
- **Stop Loss:** Below 1.0350
- **Risk Management:** EUR/USD is liquid; standard position sizing. Watch ECB speakers for policy shifts.
- **Time Horizon:** 3-5 trading sessions

---

### 6A - Australian Dollar Futures

**Bias Score:** +1 | **Bias:** Mildly Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Weak score due to RBA hawkish hike (-2) and narrowing rate differential (-1). Risk-off mood (2x, +2) and rising copper (+1) provide support. Conflicting signals.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Wait for clarity; if long, enter above 0.6450 with strong risk-on confirmation
- **Target:** 0.6550-0.6600
- **Stop Loss:** Below 0.6350
- **Risk Management:** AUD is volatile and conflicted; reduce size by 50%. Monitor RBA rhetoric and China data closely.
- **Time Horizon:** 2-4 trading sessions (low conviction)

---

### 6J - Japanese Yen Futures

**Bias Score:** +8 | **Bias:** Strongly Bullish

**Rationale:**  
Highest score (+8) driven by BoJ hawkish tightening (2x, +2), widening rate differential (2x, +4), weak USD (+1), and risk-off mood (+1). JPY strength is multi-factor and high conviction.

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Long on any dip to 0.00680-0.00685 (JPY futures) or USD/JPY short below 147.00
- **Target:** 0.00710-0.00720 (JPY futures) or USD/JPY 140.00-142.00
- **Stop Loss:** Below 0.00665 (JPY futures) or USD/JPY above 149.00
- **Risk Management:** High conviction trade; can use 2-3% risk. Monitor BoJ speakers and spring rate hike expectations. Signal decay: 1-2 weeks.
- **Time Horizon:** 7-10 trading sessions (high conviction)
