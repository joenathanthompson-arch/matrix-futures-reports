## Executive Summary

The macro environment favors **commodities** with all three instruments (Gold, Silver, WTI Crude) showing bullish bias. **Equities** present a mixed picture with small caps (RTY) and value (YM) outperforming on credit spread compression and curve steepening, while tech (NQ) and broad market (ES) show only slight bullish bias due to rising rate volatility. **FX markets** are slight bullish across the board, driven primarily by broad USD weakness.

**Key Macro Drivers:**
1. **Weak USD** supporting commodities and risk assets (DXY down 10.54% YoY)
2. **Credit spreads narrowing**, favorable for equities especially small caps (HY OAS at 2.84%)
3. **Strong commodity complex** (copper up 28.40% YoY, oil inventories drawing) signaling growth resilience
