## Macro Data Collection Summary

### 1. Federal Reserve Stance
**Source:** CME FedWatch Tool  
**URL:** https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html  
**Data Date:** January 26, 2026

**Current Policy Rate:** 4.25% - 4.50%  
**January 29, 2026 FOMC Meeting Probabilities:**
- Hold at 4.25-4.50%: **97.4%**
- Cut to 4.00-4.25%: **2.6%**

**Assessment:** Hawkish hold  
**Raw Score:** -1

**Interpretation:** Market has fully priced in a hold with minimal cut probability. This represents a hawkish shift from earlier expectations and removes a key support for risk assets. The lack of easing expectations is bearish for gold and growth-sensitive equities.

---

### 2. Real Yields (10-Year TIPS)
**Source:** CNBC Markets  
**URL:** https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10YTIP  
**Data Date:** January 24, 2026

**Current Yield:** 2.02%  
**Recent Trend:** Flat/stable around 2.00-2.02%

**Assessment:** Flat  
**Raw Score:** 0

**Interpretation:** Real yields have stabilized in the 2.00-2.02% range, providing no clear directional signal. This level is historically moderate—not low enough to strongly support gold, but not high enough to aggressively pressure it. Neutral for equities.

---

### 3. US Dollar Index (DXY)
**Source:** TradingView  
**URL:** https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-DXY/  
**Data Date:** January 26, 2026

**Current Level:** 97.06  
**Change:** -0.41%  
**Recent Trend:** Declining from 98+ levels

**Assessment:** Down  
**Raw Score:** +1

**Interpretation:** Weakening dollar provides tailwind for commodities (gold, silver, crude) and international earnings for US equities. The break below 97.50 is technically significant and suggests continued dollar weakness in the near term.

---

### 4. VIX (Volatility Index)
**Source:** CNBC Markets  
**URL:** https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.VIX  
**Data Date:** January 26, 2026

**Current Level:** 16.14  
**Change:** +0.37%  
**Recent Range:** 15-17

**Assessment:** Flat/Balanced  
**Raw Score:** 0

**Interpretation:** VIX remains in the lower end of its historical range, indicating complacency rather than fear. The 16 level is neither elevated (20+) nor suppressed (12-), suggesting balanced risk sentiment. No strong directional signal for equities.

---

### 5. Growth Narrative (Atlanta Fed GDPNow)
**Source:** Atlanta Fed GDPNow  
**URL:** https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow  
**Data Date:** January 23, 2026 (Latest Estimate)

**Q4 2025 GDP Estimate:** +3.2% (seasonally adjusted annual rate)  
**Previous Estimate:** +2.7% (January 16, 2026)  
**Change:** +0.5 percentage points

**Assessment:** Accelerating  
**Raw Score:** -1 (for gold), +1 (for equities context)

**Interpretation:** Strong upward revision indicates robust economic momentum. This is **bearish for gold** (reduces safe-haven demand and Fed easing urgency) but **mixed for equities** (fundamentally positive but reduces dovish Fed support). The acceleration suggests the economy doesn't need rate cuts, which is a headwind for duration-sensitive assets.

---

### 6. Credit Spreads (High Yield OAS)
**Source:** FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)  
**URL:** https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2  
**Data Date:** January 23, 2026

**Current Spread:** 2.68%  
**Recent Trend:** Declining from ~3.0% in late 2025  
**Historical Context:** Near multi-year lows

**Assessment:** Narrowing  
**Raw Score:** +1

**Interpretation:** Tightening credit spreads indicate strong credit market health and risk appetite. The 2.68% level is very tight historically, suggesting investors are comfortable taking credit risk. This is bullish for equities, particularly cyclical and credit-sensitive sectors.

---

### 7. Yield Curve (2s10s Spread)
**Source:** FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)  
**URL:** https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y  
**Data Date:** January 26, 2026

**Current Spread:** 0.66%  
**Recent Trend:** Steepening from ~0.20% in mid-2025  
**Historical Context:** Positive and steepening

**Assessment:** Steepening  
**Raw Score:** +1

**Interpretation:** The curve has steepened significantly from 0.20% to 0.66%, indicating improving growth expectations and reduced recession risk. Steepening curves are typically bullish for cyclical equities (especially financials) and reflect market confidence in economic expansion. This is particularly supportive for the Dow Jones (YM) given its cyclical composition.

---

### 8. Semiconductor Index (SOX)
**Source:** TradingView  
**URL:** https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOX/  
**Data Date:** January 26, 2026

**Current Level:** 7,927.04  
**Change:** -30.88 (-0.39%)  
**Performance:**
- 1 Month: +9.65%
- 6 Months: +36.94%
- 1 Year: +45.52%

**Assessment:** Up  
**Raw Score:** +1

**Interpretation:** Despite minor daily decline, SOX remains in a strong uptrend with exceptional 1-year performance (+45.52%). The semiconductor sector is a leading indicator for tech spending and AI infrastructure investment. This is bullish for Nasdaq (NQ) given heavy tech weighting.

---

### 9. MOVE Index (Bond Market Volatility)
**Source:** TradingView  
**URL:** https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-MOVE/  
**Data Date:** January 26, 2026

**Current Level:** 55.77  
**Change:** -0.48 (-0.86%)  
**Performance:**
- 5 Days: -16.36%
- 1 Month: -6.24%
- 1 Year: -36.99%

**Assessment:** Down  
**Raw Score:** +1

**Interpretation:** Declining bond volatility indicates calmer rate environment and reduced uncertainty around Fed policy. Lower MOVE is bullish for duration-sensitive assets, particularly growth stocks and tech (NQ). The sharp 1-year decline (-36.99%) suggests markets have adjusted to the new rate regime.

---

### 10. Copper Prices
**Source:** Investing.com  
**URL:** https://www.investing.com/commodities/copper  
**Data Date:** January 26, 2026

**Current Price:** $5.9055/lb  
**Change:** -$0.0420 (-0.71%)  
**Performance:**
- 1 Month: +1.13%
- 3 Months: +15.29%
- 1 Year: +37.45%

**Technical Signal:** Strong Buy (Daily)

**Assessment:** Up  
**Raw Score:** +1

**Interpretation:** Copper's strong uptrend (+37.45% YoY) reflects robust industrial demand and is a leading indicator for global growth. The +15.29% 3-month performance is particularly notable. This is bullish for silver (SI) given its industrial use case, and supports the growth narrative for equities.

---

### 11. Gold ETF Flows
**Source:** Bloomberg / World Gold Council  
**Data Date:** January 2026

**January 2026 Inflows:** $4.7 billion (US-listed gold ETFs)  
**2025 Full Year:** Record $89 billion inflows  
**Holdings Change (2025):** +220 tonnes

**Assessment:** Up  
**Raw Score:** +1

**Interpretation:** Strong and sustained inflows indicate robust institutional and retail demand for gold. The $4.7B January inflow continues the record-setting pace from 2025. This is bullish for both gold (GC) and silver (SI), though it's worth noting that flows can be a lagging indicator during price rallies.

---

### 12. Oil Supply & Inventories
**Source:** EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report  
**URL:** https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/  
**Data Date:** Week ending January 16, 2026

**Crude Oil Inventories:**
- Change: +3.6 million barrels
- Current Level: 426.0 million barrels
- vs. 5-Year Average: -2% (slightly below)

**Gasoline Inventories:**
- Change: +6.0 million barrels
- vs. 5-Year Average: +4% (above average)

**Distillate Inventories:**
- Change: +3.3 million barrels
- vs. 5-Year Average: -1% (slightly below)

**Production:**
- Gasoline: 8.8 million barrels/day (decreased)
- Distillate: 5.1 million barrels/day (decreased by 210k bpd)

**Assessment for Supply Shock:** Neutral  
**Assessment for Inventories:** Build  
**Raw Scores:** 0 (supply shock), -1 (inventories)

**Interpretation:** Inventory builds across all major products indicate no supply tightness. The 3.6M barrel crude build is significant and suggests demand is not keeping pace with supply. This is bearish for crude oil (CL) prices. The lack of supply shock removes a key bullish catalyst.

---

### 13. Geopolitical Risk
**Sources:** S&P Global, World Economic Forum, Eurasia Group, Council on Foreign Relations  
**Assessment Date:** January 2026

**Key Risk Factors:**
- **Russia-Ukraine:** Ongoing war of attrition with no resolution in sight
- **US-China:** Persistent great power competition and technology rivalry
- **Taiwan Strait:** Elevated tensions with "even chance" of crisis in 2026 (per CFR)
- **Middle East:** Gaza war winding down but Iran tensions persist
- **Russia-NATO:** Increased hybrid pressure on Europe
- **Geoeconomic:** Fragmentation and trade tensions (WEF top risk)

**Recent Developments:**
- No acute spike in past week
- Structural tensions remain elevated
- Multiple ongoing conflicts (Sudan, Myanmar, Sahel)

**Assessment:** Rising (structural, not acute)  
**Raw Score:** +1

**Interpretation:** Geopolitical risk remains structurally elevated with multiple active conflicts and great power competition. While there's no acute crisis driving immediate safe-haven flows, the persistent tensions provide a floor under gold and support for defensive positioning. The "rising" assessment reflects the structural deterioration rather than a near-term spike.

---

### SI (Silver) - Score: +1 (Slight Bullish)

| Factor | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | -1 |

---

### ES (S&P 500) - Score: 0 (Neutral)

| Factor | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | -1 |
| Real yields | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 1 | -1 | -1 |
| Credit spreads | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| VIX | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **0** |

**Signal:** Neutral (-1 to +1)  
**PM Score:** 5  
**Approach:** IB_REVERSION

**Analysis:** S&P 500 reflects balanced macro. Bullish: tight credit spreads (+1), weak USD (+1). Bearish: hawkish Fed (-1), accelerating growth reduces easing urgency (-1). Real yields (weight 2) at 0 are key—any move above 2.10% would tilt bearish. VIX at 16 shows complacency but no fear.

---

### NQ (Nasdaq 100) - Score: +1 (Slight Bullish)

| Factor | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | -1 |
| Real yields | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 1 | -1 | -1 |
| SOX (Semis) | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| MOVE (Rates vol) | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+1** |

**Signal:** Slight Bullish (+1 to +2)  
**PM Score:** 6  
**Approach:** IB_REVERSION

**Analysis:** Nasdaq gets a slight edge from tech-specific factors. Strong SOX performance (+1) and declining MOVE (+1) support duration-sensitive growth stocks. The +1 score suggests tech may outperform broad market, though Fed uncertainty remains a headwind. Real yields (weight 2) at 0 are critical—any spike would pressure tech.

### YM (Dow Jones) - Score: 0 (Neutral)

| Factor | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | -1 |
| Real yields | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 2 | -1 | -2 |
| Credit spreads | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| 2s10s curve | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **0** |

**Signal:** Neutral (-1 to +1)  
**PM Score:** 5  
**Approach:** IB_REVERSION

**Analysis:** Dow reflects cyclical dynamics. Bullish: steepening curve (+1), tight credit (+1), weak USD (+1). Bearish: growth narrative (weight 2) at -1 scores -2 because strong growth reduces Fed easing need, which has been supporting cyclicals. Hawkish Fed (-1) adds pressure. Net neutral.

---

### CL (WTI Crude) - Score: -1 (Neutral)

| Factor | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Oil supply shock | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| Inventories | 1 | -1 | -1 |
| Growth narrative | 2 | -1 | -2 |
| Geopolitical risk | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **-1** |

**Signal:** Neutral (-1 to +1)  
**PM Score:** 5  
**Approach:** IB_REVERSION

**Analysis:** Crude faces bearish supply dynamics. Inventory builds (-1) and no supply shock (0 with weight 2) indicate oversupply. Growth narrative (weight 2) at -1 scores -2 because accelerating growth is **bearish for crude** when it's not translating to tightness (suggests demand concerns). Geopolitical premium (+1) and weak USD (+1) provide floor but can't overcome supply headwinds.
