# Daily Futures Analysis Report - January 13, 2026

**Author:** Manus AI

## Executive Summary

Today's market landscape is characterized by a strong risk-on sentiment, driven by a dovish Federal Reserve, robust economic growth indicators, and well-anchored inflation expectations. Equity indices are strongly bullish, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showing particularly high bias scores. Gold and silver are also bullish, benefiting from a weaker dollar and safe-haven demand amid geopolitical concerns. Crude oil is bullish on strong growth expectations, though oversupply concerns may cap upside potential. The economic calendar is light today, with no high-impact US data releases expected.

## Market Bias Scorecard

| Instrument | Total Score | Signal | Key Drivers |
|---|---|---|---|
| GC (Gold) | +2 | Bullish | Dovish Fed, weak USD vs. positive real yields |
| NQ (Nasdaq) | +22 | Strong Bullish | Low VIX, strong growth, SOX near highs |
| ES (S&P 500) | +20 | Strong Bullish | Low VIX, strong growth, tight spreads |
| YM (Dow) | +20 | Strong Bullish | Low VIX, strong growth, positive curve |
| SI (Silver) | +13 | Strong Bullish | Strong copper, dovish Fed, tech demand |
| CL (Crude Oil) | +10 | Strong Bullish | Strong GDP growth, weak dollar |

## Detailed Instrument Analysis

### Gold (GC)

Gold exhibits a bullish bias with a score of +2. The primary drivers are a dovish Federal Reserve, with a 95% probability of no rate change, and a weaker US Dollar. These factors are partially offset by positive real yields and a low VIX, which typically reduce demand for safe-haven assets. Geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran and concerns over the Federal Reserve's independence are providing additional support for gold prices, which have recently broken through the $4,600 level.

### Nasdaq (NQ) & S&P 500 (ES)

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are strongly bullish with bias scores of +22 and +20, respectively. This outlook is supported by a confluence of positive factors, including a dovish Fed, extremely low volatility (VIX at 15.32), and strong economic growth projections (GDPNow at 5.1%). Tight credit spreads and a steepening yield curve further reinforce the positive sentiment. The SOX index trading near all-time highs provides an additional tailwind for the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

### Crude Oil (CL)

Crude oil is strongly bullish with a bias score of +10. The primary driver is the robust economic growth outlook, which suggests strong demand for energy. A weaker US Dollar and strong performance in industrial metals like copper further support the bullish case. While recent reports show a build in crude oil inventories, the market appears to be more focused on the demand side of the equation. Geopolitical risks in the Middle East also provide a floor for prices.

### Silver (SI)

Silver is strongly bullish with a bias score of +13, outperforming gold. The bullish outlook is driven by the same factors supporting gold, but with the added tailwind of strong industrial demand. The robust performance of the SOX index and the high price of copper indicate strong demand for silver in industrial applications. Silver has broken out to new all-time highs, and the momentum appears to be strong.
