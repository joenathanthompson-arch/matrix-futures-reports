# Matrix Futures Daily Bias Report - 2026-02-19

**Report Date:** February 19, 2026
**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Executive Summary

Today's report finds a **moderately bullish** risk-on sentiment driven by tightening credit spreads, a steepening yield curve, and a robust rally in the semiconductor sector (SOX). However, this optimism is tempered by elevated geopolitical risks, particularly the escalating US-Iran crisis, and a massive build in crude oil inventories. The US Dollar and real yields remain stable, providing a neutral backdrop. The Fed is firmly on hold, while the RBA has turned hawkish with a recent rate hike, and the BoJ is signaling a continued tightening path. This divergence in central bank policy is creating clear opportunities in FX futures, with a bullish bias for the Japanese Yen (6J) and a bearish bias for the Australian Dollar (6A).

### Daily Bias Scores

| Instrument | Score | Bias | Conviction | Key Drivers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NQ | +5.5 | BULLISH | High | SOX rising, credit spreads tight, MOVE falling |
| ES | +4.0 | BULLISH | Medium | Credit spreads tight, curve steepening |
| RTY | +4.5 | BULLISH | Medium | Credit spreads tight, curve steepening |
| ZN | +4.0 | BULLISH | Medium | Curve steepening, MOVE falling |
| GC | +5.0 | BULLISH | High | Gold ETF inflows, geopolitical risks |
| CL | 0.0 | NEUTRAL | Low | Geopolitical risk offset by inventory builds |
| HG | 0.0 | NEUTRAL | Low | Mixed signals, no clear trend |
| 6E | 0.0 | NEUTRAL | Low | ECB and Fed both on hold |
| 6A | -3.0 | BEARISH | Medium | RBA hawkish hike creating short-term pressure |
| 6J | +5.5 | BULLISH | High | BoJ tightening, rate differential narrowing |

### High-Conviction Trade Setups

*   **Long NQ (+5.5):** The semiconductor-led rally (SOX near all-time highs) combined with tightening credit spreads and falling bond volatility (MOVE index) provides a strong tailwind for tech stocks. The bias is strongly bullish.
*   **Long GC (+5.0):** Gold is supported by a dual mandate of strong safe-haven demand (rising geopolitical risks) and significant ETF inflows. The bias is bullish.
*   **Long 6J (+5.5):** The BoJ's clear tightening path against a neutral Fed is creating a strong bullish case for the yen. The narrowing rate differential is a powerful driver.
*   **Short 6A (-3.0):** The RBA's recent hawkish rate hike, while bullish for the AUD in the long run, is creating short-term pressure on the currency due to growth concerns. The bearish bias is supported by a neutral copper price.

## 2. Macroeconomic Analysis

### 2.1. Core Macro Factors

The overall macro environment is cautiously optimistic. Six of the thirteen core factors are bullish, while only one is bearish. The remaining six are neutral, indicating a lack of strong conviction in either direction for some asset classes.

*   **Bullish Factors:** Tightening credit spreads, a rising SOX index, falling bond market volatility (MOVE), a steepening 2s10s yield curve, strong gold ETF inflows, and rising geopolitical risk (for gold).
*   **Bearish Factors:** A large build in crude oil inventories.
*   **Neutral Factors:** A neutral Fed stance, stable real yields, a stable US Dollar, elevated but not extreme VIX, a stable growth narrative (GDPNow), and a flat copper price.

### 2.2. Central Bank Policy Divergence

The key theme in the market is the growing divergence in central bank policy. The Fed and ECB are firmly on hold, while the RBA has embarked on a hawkish hiking cycle and the BoJ is continuing its gradual path toward normalization. This divergence is creating clear opportunities in the FX markets.

*   **Fed:** On hold at 3.50-3.75%, with a 96.9% probability of no change in March.
*   **ECB:** On hold at 2.00%, with no changes expected in 2026.
*   **RBA:** Just hiked 25bps to 3.85% and is expected to hike again.
*   **BoJ:** On hold at 0.75% but expected to hike to 1.0% by June.
