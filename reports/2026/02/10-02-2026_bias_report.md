# Matrix Futures Daily Bias Report

**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Generated at:** 17:39 EST (22:39 UTC)

## Executive Summary

This report provides a quantitative daily bias for 10 key futures instruments across commodities, equity indices, and foreign exchange. The bias is derived from a weighted model of over 14 macroeconomic factors, designed to provide a directional perspective for the upcoming trading session.

**Today's Key Drivers:**

*   **Falling Real Yields:** A significant drop in real yields is providing a strong tailwind for risk assets, particularly precious metals and equities. The 10-year TIPS yield has fallen to 0.45%, making non-yielding assets like gold more attractive and boosting the valuation of growth-oriented stocks.
*   **Weaker US Dollar:** The US Dollar Index (DXY) has continued its decline, trading around 96.86. This broad-based dollar weakness is supportive for commodities priced in USD and provides a lift to foreign currencies.
*   **Supportive Credit Environment:** High-yield credit spreads continue to narrow, indicating a calm and risk-on sentiment in the credit markets. This is a positive signal for equities, especially small-cap stocks which are more sensitive to credit conditions.

**Asset Class Bias:**

| Asset Class | Bias | Key Drivers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commodities** | **BULLISH** | Weak USD, falling real yields, strong gold ETF inflows, and a draw in oil inventories. |
| **Equity Indices** | **STRONG_BULLISH** | Falling real yields, narrowing credit spreads, and a stable growth outlook. |
| **FX** | **BULLISH** | Broad-based USD weakness is the primary driver, though individual currency pairs show divergence based on central bank policies. |
