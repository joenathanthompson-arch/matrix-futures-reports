### Quick Summary

| Asset Class | Bias | Top Instrument | Score |
|-------------|------|----------------|-------|
| **FX** | BULLISH | 6A (Australian Dollar) | +7 |
| **Indices** | MIXED | RTY (Russell 2000) | +2 |
| **Commodities** | MIXED | CL (Crude Oil) | +2 |

### Top 3 Opportunities
1. **6A (Australian Dollar)** - Score: +7 - STRONG_BULLISH - Risk-on sentiment + China growth
2. **RTY (Russell 2000)** - Score: +2 - SLIGHT_BULLISH - Credit conditions + curve steepening
3. **CL (Crude Oil)** - Score: +2 - SLIGHT_BULLISH - Inventory draw + USD weakness

### Key Macro Themes
- Rising real yields create headwind for rate-sensitive assets (gold, tech)
- Broad USD weakness supports commodities and non-USD currencies
- Risk-on environment (VIX falling, credit spreads tight) favors cyclicals
- Strong growth (4.2% GDPNow) and dovish Fed expectations
- Small caps and value outperform on credit conditions and curve steepening

## Report Files

Each daily report is generated in multiple formats:

- **Markdown (.md)** - Comprehensive human-readable analysis with detailed rationale
- **JSON (.json)** - Structured data for programmatic access and API integration
- **CSV (.csv)** - Tabular format for spreadsheet analysis and backtesting

### File Naming Convention

`daily_bias_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.{md,json,csv}`

Example: `daily_bias_2026-02-02_1942.md`

## Methodology

The bias scoring system evaluates 14+ macroeconomic factors with differential weighting based on asset-specific sensitivities:

- **Fed Stance** - Hawkish/Dovish expectations from CME FedWatch
- **Real Yields** - 10Y TIPS yields (2x weight for gold, equities)
- **USD Strength** - DXY Dollar Index
- **Risk Sentiment** - VIX, credit spreads, risk-on/risk-off
- **Growth** - GDPNow, PMIs, employment data
- **Credit Conditions** - High-yield spreads (2x weight for small caps)
- **Yield Curve** - 2s10s spread
- **Commodity-Specific** - SOX for tech, copper for AUD, oil inventories
- **FX-Specific** - Rate differentials, central bank policy

### Scoring Scale

| Score Range | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| +6 to +10 | STRONG_BULLISH | High conviction long |
| +3 to +5 | BULLISH | Moderate conviction long |
| 0 to +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Weak long bias |
| -2 to -1 | NEUTRAL / SLIGHT_BEARISH | No clear direction |
| -3 to -5 | BEARISH | Moderate conviction short |
| -6 to -10 | STRONG_BEARISH | High conviction short |

### Confidence Levels

- **7** - High-quality, current data with clear directional signals
- **6** - Good data quality but some mixed signals or minor staleness
- **5** - Reduced confidence due to data limitations or conflicting signals
