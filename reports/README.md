## Methodology

The bias scoring system evaluates 14+ macroeconomic factors with differential weighting based on asset-specific sensitivities:

- **Fed Stance** - Hawkish/Dovish expectations from CME FedWatch
- **Real Yields** - 10Y TIPS yields (2x weight for gold, equities)
- **USD Strength** - DXY Dollar Index
- **Risk Sentiment** - VIX, credit spreads, risk-on/risk-off
- **Growth** - GDPNow, PMIs, employment data
- **Credit Conditions** - High-yield spreads (2x weight for small caps)
- **Yield Curve** - 2s10s spread
- **Commodity-Specific** - SOX for tech, copper for AUD, oil inventories
- **FX-Specific** - Rate differentials, central bank policy

### Scoring Scale

| Score Range | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| +5 to +10 | STRONG_BULLISH | High conviction long |
| +3 to +4 | BULLISH | Moderate conviction long |
| -1 to +1 | NEUTRAL | No clear direction |
| -2 to -4 | BEARISH | Moderate conviction short |
| -5 to -10 | STRONG_BEARISH | High conviction short |

### Confidence Levels

- **7** - High-quality, current data with clear directional signals
- **6** - Good data quality but some mixed signals or minor staleness
- **5** - Reduced confidence due to data limitations or conflicting signals
