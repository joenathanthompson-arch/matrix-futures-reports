## Executive Summary

All asset classes show **bullish bias** across the board, driven by USD weakness, narrowing credit spreads, and hawkish central bank moves outside the US. The strongest signals come from Japanese Yen (6J) at +5 and Australian Dollar (6A) at +4, both benefiting from surprise hawkish policy shifts. Equities are supported by narrowing credit spreads, with small caps (RTY) leading at +4. Commodities are uniformly bullish, with crude oil (CL) at +3 supported by inventory draws and geopolitical tensions.

---

## Key Drivers

1. **USD weakness benefiting all asset classes across commodities, equities, and FX**
2. **Credit spreads narrowing to 2.88%, supportive for risk assets especially small caps**
3. **RBA surprise hike and BoJ hawkish stance driving strong AUD and JPY performance**

## Asset Class Breakdown

### Commodities: **BULLISH**

All three commodities show bullish bias, with an average score of **+2.0**. USD weakness is a common supportive factor across gold, silver, and crude oil.

- **GC (Gold):** +1 SLIGHT_BULLISH — USD weakness is the primary driver. Gold ETF flows have been volatile with strong inflows in January but a historic selloff late in the month. Geopolitical tensions provide some support but are not in the gold scoring model.

- **SI (Silver):** +2 SLIGHT_BULLISH — USD weakness and copper strength (+4.12%) support silver. However, silver experienced a historic 34% one-day drop recently alongside gold's selloff.

- **CL (WTI Crude):** +3 BULLISH — Inventory draw (2.3M barrels), elevated geopolitical risk (Iran, Venezuela), and USD weakness all support oil. Growth remains stable at 4.2%.

### Indices: **BULLISH**

All four indices show bullish bias, with an average score of **+3.0**. Narrowing credit spreads and USD weakness are key drivers.

- **ES (S&P 500):** +2 SLIGHT_BULLISH — Narrowing credit spreads (2.88%) and USD weakness support equities. VIX is balanced and stable, indicating calm market conditions.

- **NQ (NASDAQ 100):** +3 BULLISH — SOX strength (+1.70%, +11.60% over 1 month, +60.81% over 1 year) is highly supportive for tech. Falling rate volatility (MOVE -7.29% over 1 month) and USD weakness also support NASDAQ.

- **YM (Dow Jones):** +3 BULLISH — Narrowing credit spreads and steepening yield curve (0.72%) support value-oriented Dow. Stable growth at 4.2% is constructive.

- **RTY (Russell 2000):** +4 BULLISH — Small caps benefit most from narrowing credit spreads (2.88%, 2x weight). Steepening curve and USD weakness also supportive. Stable growth is constructive.

### FX: **BULLISH**

All three FX pairs show bullish bias against USD, with an average score of **+3.3**. JPY is strongest due to BoJ hawkishness, followed by AUD on RBA surprise hike.

- **M6E (Euro):** +1 SLIGHT_BULLISH — USD weakness is the primary driver for EUR. Both Fed and ECB are on hold, so rate differential is stable. Eurozone growth is stabilizing.

- **6A (Australian Dollar):** +4 BULLISH — **RBA delivered a surprise 25bps hike to 3.85% TODAY (Feb 3, 2026)**, the first hike in two years. This is a major hawkish move. Copper strength (+4.12%, +41.45% over 1 year) and USD weakness provide additional support. China growth is stable.

- **6J (Japanese Yen):** +5 STRONG_BULLISH — BoJ policymakers are debating being "behind the curve" on inflation, suggesting further tightening ahead. Rate differential is widening in favor of JPY as BoJ normalizes while Fed stays on hold. USD weakness provides additional support.
