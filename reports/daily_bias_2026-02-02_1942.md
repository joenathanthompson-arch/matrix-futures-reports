## Executive Summary

The macro environment on February 2, 2026 presents a **mixed picture** with rising real yields creating headwinds for rate-sensitive assets while broad USD weakness and risk-on sentiment support commodities and cyclicals. The **strongest bullish setup is Australian Dollar (6A)** with a score of +7, benefiting from risk-on conditions and strong China growth indicators. **Gold (GC) shows the most bearish setup** at -2, pressured by rising real yields despite dovish Fed expectations.

### Key Macro Themes

The current macro landscape is characterized by several competing forces. **Rising real yields** (10Y TIPS at 1.944%, up from 1.90%) create a significant headwind for gold and growth-oriented equities, as higher real rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and compress equity valuations. However, this is offset by **broad-based USD weakness**, with the Dollar Index (DXY) at 97.604, near four-year lows and down approximately 10% over the past year, which provides tailwinds for commodities and non-USD currencies.

The **risk environment remains constructive**, evidenced by VIX falling 6.31% to 16.34 and high-yield credit spreads narrowing to 2.88%, near multi-year lows. This risk-on sentiment, combined with strong economic growth (GDPNow at 4.2%) and dovish Fed expectations (89% probability of hold with 11% cut probability), creates a favorable backdrop for cyclical assets and small-cap equities. The **steepening yield curve** (2s10s at +0.72%) further supports value stocks and financials, while **strong copper prices** ($5.88/lb, up 37% year-over-year) signal healthy industrial demand and China growth.

## Asset Class Aggregate Views

### Commodities: MIXED
The commodity complex shows **no clear directional consensus**, with 2 out of 3 instruments bullish but lacking unanimity. **Silver (+1)** and **Crude Oil (+2)** benefit from USD weakness and favorable supply-demand dynamics, while **Gold (-2)** faces significant pressure from rising real yields despite strong ETF inflows ($2.58B in GLD during January). The divergence reflects gold's sensitivity to real rates versus the industrial demand component supporting silver and oil's response to inventory draws.

### Indices: MIXED
Equity indices display **divergent performance expectations** based on sector composition and rate sensitivity. Large-cap growth indices **ES (-1)** and **NQ (-1)** face headwinds from rising real yields, though strong semiconductor performance (SOX near all-time highs) and falling bond volatility provide partial offsets. In contrast, **YM (+1)** and **RTY (+2)** benefit from steepening yield curves and exceptionally tight credit spreads (2.88% HY OAS), with small caps showing the strongest setup due to their higher sensitivity to credit conditions and domestic growth exposure.

### FX: BULLISH
The foreign exchange complex shows **unanimous bullish bias** across all three instruments, driven by broad-based USD weakness. **AUD (6A) leads with a score of +7**, the strongest across all asset classes, benefiting from risk-on sentiment (weighted 2x) and strong China growth indicators evidenced by copper's 37% year-over-year gain. **EUR (M6E) and JPY (6J) both score +1**, supported by dovish Fed expectations and DXY weakness, though confidence is reduced to 5 due to lack of current ECB and BoJ policy data.

## Detailed Instrument Analysis

### GC (Gold Futures) | Score: -2 | SLIGHT_BEARISH | Confidence: 7

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- Real Yields (Rising, 1.944%): -4 (weight 2)
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Mood (Risk-On): -1
- Growth (Stable, 4.2%): 0
- Gold ETF Flows (Strong Inflows): +1

**Rationale:** Gold faces a **dominant bearish factor** in the form of rising real yields, which carry a 2x weight in the scoring methodology. The 10-year TIPS yield has risen to 1.944% from 1.90%, creating an opportunity cost for holding non-yielding gold. While dovish Fed expectations (89% hold, 11% cut probability), USD weakness (DXY at 4-year lows), and strong ETF inflows ($2.58B into GLD in January) provide support, these bullish factors cannot overcome the -4 weighted impact of rising real rates. The risk-on environment (VIX falling, credit spreads tight) also works against gold's safe-haven appeal.

---

### SI (Silver Futures) | Score: +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 7

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- Real Yields (Rising, 1.944%): -2
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Mood (Risk-On): -1
- Growth (Stable, 4.2%): 0
- Copper (Rising, $5.88/lb): +1
- Gold ETF Flows (Strong Inflows): +1

**Rationale:** Silver demonstrates **better resilience than gold** to rising real yields due to its dual nature as both a precious and industrial metal. The strong performance of copper (+37% year-over-year, +0.89% today) signals robust industrial demand, which benefits silver's industrial component. USD weakness and dovish Fed expectations provide additional support. While silver still faces headwinds from rising real yields and the risk-on environment (which reduces safe-haven demand), the industrial demand factor and lower weight on real yields (1x versus gold's 2x) result in a net positive score.

---

### CL (Crude Oil Futures) | Score: +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 6

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Oil Supply (Neutral): 0 (weight 2)
- Inventories (Draw, -2.3M bbl): +1
- Growth (Stable, 4.2%): 0 (weight 2)
- Geopolitical (Stable): 0
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1

**Rationale:** Crude oil shows a **slight bullish bias** supported by recent inventory draws and USD weakness. The latest EIA data (week ending January 28) showed a draw of 2.3 million barrels, reversing earlier builds in January. Commercial crude stocks stand at approximately 423.8 million barrels. USD weakness at four-year lows provides a tailwind for dollar-denominated commodities. However, the bullish case is tempered by neutral supply conditions (no major OPEC changes or geopolitical disruptions) and stable rather than accelerating growth (GDPNow at 4.2% but unchanged). Confidence is reduced to 6 due to mixed inventory signals throughout January.

---

### ES (S&P 500 E-mini) | Score: -1 | NEUTRAL | Confidence: 6

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- Real Yields (Rising, 1.944%): -4 (weight 2)
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Mood (Risk-On): -1
- Growth (Stable, 4.2%): 0
- Credit Spreads (Narrowing, 2.88%): +1
- VIX Direction (Falling, -6.31%): +1

**Rationale:** The S&P 500 faces **offsetting forces** resulting in a neutral-to-slightly-bearish stance. Rising real yields create a significant headwind (weighted -4), as higher real rates compress equity valuations and increase the discount rate for future cash flows. However, this is partially offset by exceptionally strong credit conditions (HY spreads at 2.88%, near multi-year lows), falling volatility (VIX down 6.31% to 16.34), and dovish Fed expectations. The risk-on environment paradoxically scores -1 for equities in this framework as it suggests complacency. The score of -1 indicates a neutral stance with a slight bearish tilt, suggesting caution rather than aggressive positioning.

---

### NQ (NASDAQ 100 E-mini) | Score: -1 | NEUTRAL | Confidence: 6

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- Real Yields (Rising, 1.944%): -4 (weight 2)
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Mood (Risk-On): -1
- Growth (Stable, 4.2%): 0
- SOX (Rising, 8,134): +1
- MOVE (Falling, 59.30): +1

**Rationale:** The NASDAQ 100 faces a **similar setup to the S&P 500** with rising real yields as the dominant headwind. However, tech-specific factors provide some differentiation. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) is near all-time highs at 8,134, up 1.70% today and 11.60% over the past month, indicating strong momentum in the semiconductor sector that comprises a significant portion of NQ. Additionally, the MOVE Index (bond volatility) has fallen 34.5% over the past year to 59.30, suggesting a stable rate environment that typically benefits duration-sensitive growth stocks. Despite these supportive factors, the -4 weighted impact of rising real yields dominates, resulting in a neutral score with slight bearish tilt.

### YM (Dow Jones E-mini) | Score: +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 6

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- Real Yields (Rising, 1.944%): -2
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Mood (Risk-On): -1
- Growth (Stable, 4.2%): 0 (weight 2)
- Credit Spreads (Narrowing, 2.88%): +1
- 2s10s Curve (Steepening, 0.72%): +1

**Rationale:** The Dow Jones shows **relative outperformance** versus large-cap growth indices due to its value-oriented composition. The key differentiator is the steepening yield curve (2s10s at +0.72%, up from inverted levels in 2023), which historically benefits financials and value stocks that comprise a larger portion of the Dow. Additionally, the Dow carries only a 1x weight on real yields versus 2x for growth-heavy indices, reducing its sensitivity to the rising real rate environment. Strong credit conditions (2.88% HY spreads) and stable growth at 4.2% support the cyclical and financial components of the index. The combination results in a slight bullish bias.

---

### RTY (Russell 2000 E-mini) | Score: +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 7

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- Real Yields (Rising, 1.944%): -2
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Mood (Risk-On): -1
- Growth (Stable, 4.2%): 0 (weight 2)
- Credit Spreads (Narrowing, 2.88%): +2 (weight 2)
- 2s10s Curve (Steepening, 0.72%): +1

**Rationale:** The Russell 2000 emerges as the **strongest equity index setup** with a score of +2, driven primarily by exceptionally tight credit conditions that carry a 2x weight for small caps. High-yield spreads at 2.88% are near multi-year lows, indicating strong credit availability and low default risk, which disproportionately benefits smaller, more credit-sensitive companies. The steepening yield curve (+0.72%) further supports small caps and regional banks. USD weakness benefits the domestic-focused small-cap universe, and dovish Fed expectations reduce refinancing risks. While rising real yields remain a headwind, the weighted impact of credit conditions (+2) and curve steepening create a net positive bias.

### M6E (Euro FX Futures) | Score: +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 5

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- ECB Stance (Assumed Neutral): 0
- Rate Differential EUR-USD (Flat): 0 (weight 2)
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Mood (Risk-On): -1
- Eurozone Growth (Stable): 0

**Rationale:** The Euro shows a **slight bullish bias** driven primarily by broad-based USD weakness. The Dollar Index at 97.604 represents four-year lows and a 10% decline over the past year, creating a favorable environment for EUR/USD appreciation. Dovish Fed expectations (89% hold, 11% cut probability) support the Euro by reducing the interest rate differential advantage of the dollar. However, the bullish case is limited by the lack of current ECB policy data, resulting in assumed neutral stance and flat rate differential (weighted 2x). The risk-on environment typically favors USD over EUR as a funding currency, contributing a -1 impact. Confidence is reduced to 5 due to data limitations on ECB policy.

### 6A (Australian Dollar Futures) | Score: +7 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence: 7

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- RBA Stance (Assumed Neutral): 0
- Rate Differential AUD-USD (Flat): 0
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Sentiment (Risk-On): +2 (weight 2)
- China Growth (Stable/Improving, copper proxy): +2 (weight 2)
- Copper (Rising, $5.88/lb): +1

**Rationale:** The Australian Dollar presents the **strongest bullish setup across all instruments** with a score of +7, reflecting perfect alignment of multiple weighted factors. As a high-beta currency, AUD benefits significantly from the risk-on environment (weighted 2x), evidenced by VIX falling 6.31% to 16.34 and credit spreads at 2.88%. The most compelling factor is strong China growth, proxied by copper's exceptional performance: up 37% year-over-year, 33% over six months, and 16.4% over three months. This copper strength (weighted 2x for AUD) signals robust Chinese industrial demand, critical for Australia's commodity export economy. Combined with broad USD weakness (DXY at four-year lows) and dovish Fed expectations, all factors align bullishly for AUD.

---

### 6J (Japanese Yen Futures) | Score: +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 5

**Weighted Factor Breakdown:**
- Fed Stance (Dovish Hold): +1
- BoJ Stance (Assumed Neutral): 0 (weight 2)
- Rate Differential JPY-USD (Flat): 0 (weight 2)
- USD (Weak, 97.604): +1
- Risk Mood (Risk-On): -1

**Rationale:** The Japanese Yen shows a **slight bullish bias** driven by USD weakness, though the setup is less compelling than other currencies. Dovish Fed expectations and DXY at four-year lows provide tailwinds for JPY appreciation. However, the risk-on environment (VIX falling, credit spreads tight) typically works against the safe-haven yen, as investors move away from defensive assets. The lack of current Bank of Japan policy data results in assumed neutral stance and flat rate differential, both carrying 2x weights, which limits the bullish conviction. Confidence is reduced to 5 due to data limitations on BoJ policy and the conflicting signals between USD weakness and risk-on sentiment.

## Data Quality and Methodology Notes

### Data Sources and Freshness

The report incorporates **real-time and near-real-time data** from multiple authoritative sources. Fed expectations are derived from the CME FedWatch Tool (February 2, 2026), showing 89% probability of hold and 11% probability of cut. Real yields are sourced from CNBC's US10YTIP quote at 1.944% (February 2), used as a fallback after FRED data showed staleness from January 30. The Dollar Index (DXY) at 97.604 and VIX at 16.34 are from TradingView real-time quotes. Credit spreads (BAMLH0A0HYM2) are from FRED at 2.88% as of January 31, considered acceptable at one day old. Growth data from Atlanta Fed GDPNow shows 4.2% for Q4 2025, updated February 2.

Additional factors include SOX at 8,134.49, MOVE Index at 59.30, 2s10s yield curve at 0.72% (all February 2), copper futures at $5.8843/lb from Investing.com, and gold ETF flows showing $2.58B January inflows to GLD per Reuters. Oil inventories reflect EIA data for the week ending January 28 with a 2.3M barrel draw.

### Confidence Adjustments

**Confidence scores range from 5 to 7** based on data quality and signal clarity. Scores of 7 (GC, SI, RTY, 6A) reflect high-quality, current data with clear directional signals. Scores of 6 (CL, ES, NQ, YM) indicate good data quality but some mixed signals or minor staleness. Scores of 5 (M6E, 6J) reflect reduced confidence due to lack of current ECB and BoJ policy data, requiring assumptions of neutral stances.

The **crude oil confidence reduction to 6** stems from mixed inventory signals throughout January, with builds earlier in the month followed by the recent draw. The **FX confidence reductions to 5** for EUR and JPY reflect the absence of recent central bank communications or policy updates, necessitating neutral assumptions for ECB and BoJ stances and flat rate differentials.

### Weighting Methodology

The scoring system applies **differential weights** based on asset-specific sensitivities. Gold carries a 2x weight on real yields due to its non-yielding nature and inverse correlation with real rates. Equity indices (ES, NQ) also carry 2x weights on real yields due to valuation sensitivity. Crude oil applies 2x weights to supply conditions and growth, reflecting fundamental drivers. Small caps (RTY) carry 2x weights on credit spreads and growth due to higher credit sensitivity and domestic focus. FX instruments apply 2x weights to rate differentials and country-specific factors (risk sentiment for AUD, BoJ stance for JPY).

All factor scores are **bounded at -2 to +2** before weighting, ensuring no single factor dominates excessively. The weighted scores are then summed to produce final bias scores, which are interpreted as: -10 to -6 (Strong Bearish), -5 to -3 (Bearish), -2 to -1 (Slight Bearish/Neutral), 0 to +2 (Slight Bullish), +3 to +5 (Bullish), +6 to +10 (Strong Bullish).

## Trading Implications and Considerations

### Signal Decay and Time Horizon

The bias scores presented in this report reflect **current macro conditions as of February 2, 2026** and should be considered most relevant for the **next 1-5 trading sessions**. Signal decay is particularly important for high-conviction scores such as the +7 for AUD, where the underlying catalysts (risk-on sentiment, copper strength) could shift with new economic data or geopolitical events. Traders should monitor upcoming releases including the February 4 EIA petroleum report, February 3 FRED updates for credit spreads and yield curve data, and any central bank communications from the ECB, RBA, or BoJ.

### Risk Management Considerations

The **mixed signals across asset classes** suggest a market in transition rather than a clear directional regime. The divergence between rising real yields (bearish for gold and growth stocks) and risk-on sentiment (bullish for cyclicals and commodities) creates potential for volatility if one theme begins to dominate. Traders should consider **position sizing appropriate to confidence levels**, with larger positions in high-confidence setups (6A at confidence 7) and smaller or hedged positions in lower-confidence setups (M6E, 6J at confidence 5).

The **neutral scores for large-cap indices** (ES and NQ at -1) suggest a market environment where **stock selection and sector rotation** may be more important than broad index exposure. The relative strength of small caps (RTY +2) and value (YM +1) versus growth (NQ -1) indicates potential opportunities in factor-based strategies.

### Correlation and Portfolio Construction

The **strong bullish bias across all FX instruments** (M6E +1, 6A +7, 6J +1) reflects a dominant USD weakness theme that could serve as a portfolio hedge or standalone opportunity. However, traders should note that **AUD's +7 score is driven by different factors** (risk-on, China growth) than EUR and JPY (primarily USD weakness), suggesting AUD may outperform in a continued risk-on environment but could underperform if risk sentiment shifts.

The **commodity complex divergence** (GC -2, SI +1, CL +2) suggests opportunities in relative value trades, such as long silver/short gold to capture the industrial demand theme while hedging precious metals exposure, or long crude oil to benefit from inventory draws and USD weakness without the real yield headwind facing gold.

---

## Conclusion

The February 2, 2026 macro environment presents a **nuanced landscape** requiring careful navigation across asset classes. The dominant themes of rising real yields and USD weakness create opposing forces, resulting in divergent outcomes across instruments. The **Australian Dollar (6A) emerges as the highest-conviction opportunity** with a score of +7, benefiting from aligned risk-on sentiment and strong China growth indicators. In contrast, **Gold (GC) faces the most challenging setup** at -2, pressured by rising real yields despite supportive factors.

Equity markets show **clear factor rotation**, with small caps (RTY +2) and value (YM +1) outperforming large-cap growth (ES -1, NQ -1) due to credit conditions and yield curve dynamics. The **unanimous bullish bias in FX** reflects broad USD weakness, though conviction varies significantly by currency. Commodities display **mixed signals**, with industrial metals and energy outperforming precious metals.

Traders should approach this environment with **flexibility and risk awareness**, recognizing that the current macro setup could shift rapidly with new data releases or policy communications. The methodology employed in this report provides a systematic framework for evaluating these complex, multi-factor relationships, but should be combined with technical analysis, market structure considerations, and appropriate risk management for optimal trading outcomes.
