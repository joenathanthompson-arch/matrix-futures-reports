## Executive Summary

The overall market bias is **STRONG_BULLISH**, driven primarily by falling real yields and a weakening US Dollar. All three major asset classes—Indices, Commodities, and FX—are showing a bullish bias. Equity indices are uniformly strong, led by the Russell 2000. In commodities, precious metals are strongly bullish, while crude oil is neutral. In FX, the Japanese Yen shows the most significant strength due to the BoJ's hawkish stance. A key cautionary signal is the sharp rise in both equity (VIX) and rate (MOVE) volatility, which warrants close monitoring.

## Asset Class Bias

| Asset Class | Bias | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **INDICES** | **STRONG_BULLISH** | 4/4 instruments bullish. Falling real yields provide a major tailwind. |
| **COMMODITIES** | **BULLISH** | 2/3 instruments bullish. Precious metals strong on falling real yields and weak USD. |
| **FX** | **BULLISH** | 3/3 instruments bullish. Driven by broad USD weakness and specific central bank actions (BoJ, RBA). |
