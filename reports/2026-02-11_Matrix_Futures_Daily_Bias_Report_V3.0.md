# Matrix Futures Daily Bias Report V3.0
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Methodology Version:** 3.0_STRATEGY
--- 
## Overall Bias & Key Drivers
The current market environment presents a **Slightly Bullish** to **Mixed** picture, driven by a weakening US Dollar and strong performance in key industrial commodities, balanced against rising volatility in the bond market and a neutral stance from the Federal Reserve. Equity indices are showing signs of a potential pause after a strong run, while FX markets are positioned for continued dollar weakness.

**Key Drivers:**
- Weak US Dollar (DXY down 1.26% week, 2.44% month)
- Neutral Fed Stance (78.3% hold probability for March)
- Strong Copper Rally (+3.29% week, +19.27% quarter)
- Crude Oil Inventory Draw (-3.5M barrels)
- Rising Bond Volatility (MOVE +12.25% week)
