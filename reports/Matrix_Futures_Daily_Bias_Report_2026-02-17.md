## Key Macro Drivers & Data Quality

### Top 3 Macro Drivers

1.  **Falling Real Yields:** The 10-Year US Treasury real yield has continued to decline, providing a significant tailwind for non-yielding assets like Gold and growth-oriented equities.
2.  **Weakening US Dollar:** The DXY has shown persistent weakness, which is broadly supportive for commodities and foreign currencies.
3.  **Supportive Credit Conditions:** Narrowing high-yield credit spreads and a steepening 2s10s yield curve indicate a healthy risk appetite in the market, which is bullish for equities, particularly small caps and cyclicals.

### Data Quality Assessment

*   **Stale Data:** Some data points for real yields and credit spreads were slightly stale (1-5 days). Fallback sources were used where necessary to ensure the most current data was incorporated.
*   **Fallbacks Used:** CNBC was used as a fallback for real-time 10Y TIPS yields and the 2s10s spread due to FRED data latency.
*   **Overall Confidence:** High. The key drivers are clear and supported by multiple data points.
