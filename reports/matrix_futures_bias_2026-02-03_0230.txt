                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

All asset classes show BULLISH bias across the board, driven by USD weakness,
narrowing credit spreads, and hawkish central bank moves outside the US. The
strongest signals come from Japanese Yen (6J) at +5 and Australian Dollar (6A)
at +4, both benefiting from surprise hawkish policy shifts. Equities are
supported by narrowing credit spreads, with small caps (RTY) leading at +4.
Commodities are uniformly bullish, with crude oil (CL) at +3 supported by
inventory draws and geopolitical tensions.

================================================================================
                              KEY DRIVERS
================================================================================

1. USD weakness benefiting all asset classes across commodities, equities,
   and FX

2. Credit spreads narrowing to 2.88%, supportive for risk assets especially
   small caps

3. RBA surprise hike and BoJ hawkish stance driving strong AUD and JPY
   performance

                        INSTRUMENT BIAS SUMMARY
================================================================================

COMMODITIES
-----------

GC (Gold)
  Score: +1 | Signal: SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 6/10
  USD weakness (+1) is the primary driver. Gold ETF flows have been volatile
  with strong inflows in January but a historic selloff late in the month.
  Geopolitical tensions provide some support but are not in the gold scoring
  model.

SI (Silver)
  Score: +2 | Signal: SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 6/10
  USD weakness and copper strength (+4.12%) support silver. However, silver
  experienced a historic 34% one-day drop recently alongside gold's selloff.

CL (WTI Crude)
  Score: +3 | Signal: BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10
  Inventory draw (2.3M barrels), elevated geopolitical risk (Iran, Venezuela),
  and USD weakness all support oil. Growth remains stable at 4.2%.

INDICES
-------

ES (S&P 500)
  Score: +2 | Signal: SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 6/10
  Narrowing credit spreads (2.88%) and USD weakness support equities. VIX is
  balanced and stable, indicating calm market conditions.

NQ (NASDAQ 100)
  Score: +3 | Signal: BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10
  SOX strength (+1.70%, +11.60% over 1 month, +60.81% over 1 year) is highly
  supportive for tech. Falling rate volatility (MOVE -7.29% over 1 month) and
  USD weakness also support NASDAQ.

YM (Dow Jones)
  Score: +3 | Signal: BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10
  Narrowing credit spreads and steepening yield curve (0.72%) support value-
  oriented Dow. Stable growth at 4.2% is constructive.

RTY (Russell 2000)
  Score: +4 | Signal: BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10
  Small caps benefit most from narrowing credit spreads (2.88%, 2x weight).
  Steepening curve and USD weakness also supportive. Stable growth is
  constructive.

FX
--

M6E (Euro)
  Score: +1 | Signal: SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence: 6/10
  USD weakness is the primary driver for EUR. Both Fed and ECB are on hold,
  so rate differential is stable. Eurozone growth is stabilizing.

6A (Australian Dollar)
  Score: +4 | Signal: BULLISH | Confidence: 8/10
  RBA delivered a surprise 25bps hike to 3.85% TODAY (Feb 3, 2026), the first
  hike in two years. This is a major hawkish move. Copper strength (+4.12%,
  +41.45% over 1 year) and USD weakness provide additional support. China
  growth is stable.

6J (Japanese Yen)
  Score: +5 | Signal: STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence: 8/10
  BoJ policymakers are debating being "behind the curve" on inflation,
  suggesting further tightening ahead. Rate differential is widening in favor
  of JPY as BoJ normalizes while Fed stays on hold. USD weakness provides
  additional support.

================================================================================
                        ASSET CLASS BREAKDOWN

COMMODITIES: BULLISH
  Average Score: +2.0
  All three commodities show bullish bias. USD weakness is a common supportive
  factor across gold, silver, and crude oil.

INDICES: BULLISH

  All four indices show bullish bias. Narrowing credit spreads and USD weakness
  are key drivers.

FX: BULLISH

  BoJ hawkishness, followed by AUD on RBA surprise hike.
