**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a slight bullish bias, primarily driven by a weaker US Dollar (DXY at 96.993) and continued strong inflows into Gold ETFs (+$10bn in December). However, with real yields estimated to be flat and the Fed expected to hold rates, the upward momentum is limited. The recommended trading approach is **IB_REVERSION (6/10)**, looking for mean-reversion opportunities as the market digests the conflicting signals.

**SI (Silver):** Silver exhibits a slight bullish bias, benefiting from the weaker US Dollar, positive sentiment in gold, and strength in industrial metals, as evidenced by the rise in copper prices to $6.0192/lb. The combination of monetary and industrial factors supports a constructive outlook. The recommended trading approach is **IB_REVERSION (6/10)**, aligning with the broader precious metals sentiment.

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 presents a neutral stance. While a weaker dollar and narrowing credit spreads (estimated) provide some support, the elevated VIX (16.25) and flat real yields suggest caution. The market appears to be in a holding pattern, awaiting a clearer catalyst. The recommended trading approach is **IB_REVERSION (5/10)**, reflecting the mixed and uncertain environment.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 is also neutral. The weaker dollar is a positive factor, but this is offset by flat performance in the semiconductor sector (SOX) and stable (though stale) readings from the MOVE index. The lack of strong directional drivers from its key components points to consolidation. The recommended trading approach is **IB_REVERSION (5/10)**.

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones shows a slight bullish bias. The weaker dollar, steepening yield curve (estimated), and narrowing credit spreads (estimated) create a favorable backdrop for this more value-oriented index. The stable growth narrative from GDPNow further underpins this view. The recommended trading approach is **IB_REVERSION (6/10)**.

**CL (WTI Crude):** Crude oil is neutral with a slight bullish tilt. Rising geopolitical risk, particularly tensions involving the US and Iran, provides a supportive floor for prices. However, this is counteracted by a recent build in US crude inventories (+3.6M barrels). The weaker dollar offers a tailwind. The recommended trading approach is **IB_REVERSION (6/10)**, balancing supply concerns with geopolitical risk premiums.
