## Executive Summary

**Asset Class Biases:**
- **Commodities:** BULLISH - All three commodities showing bullish bias
- **Indices:** MIXED - Value stocks outperforming tech on curve steepening
- **FX:** BULLISH - Diverging central bank policies create opportunities

**Top 3 Key Drivers:**
1. Diverging central bank policies: RBA and BoJ tightening while Fed/ECB on hold, creating FX opportunities
2. Commodity support from inventory draws and geopolitical tensions, plus gold ETF inflows
3. Equity markets mixed as SOX weakness weighs on tech while curve steepening supports value
