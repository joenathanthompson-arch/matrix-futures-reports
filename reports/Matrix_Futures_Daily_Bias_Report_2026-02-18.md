**Date:** February 18, 2026

## Executive Summary

This report provides a quantitative daily bias for 10 key futures instruments based on a weighted analysis of 18 real-time macroeconomic factors. The scoring methodology is detailed in the *Macro Bias Scorer Reference* document [1]. Today's analysis reveals a mixed but discernible risk tone. Equity indices show a slight bullish bias, with the Dow (YM) and S&P 500 (ES) leading, driven by narrowing credit spreads and a steepening yield curve. However, rising real yields and a strong US Dollar are creating significant headwinds for technology stocks (NQ) and precious metals (GC, SI). Crude oil (CL) is strongly bearish following a massive inventory build. In FX, the Australian Dollar (6A) is bullish on a hawkish RBA, while the Euro (M6E) and Japanese Yen (6J) are bearish against the dollar.

## Overall Market Bias

| Category | Bias | Key Drivers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US Equities** | **Cautiously Bullish** | Narrowing credit spreads, steepening yield curve, strong SOX. Headwinds from rising real yields and elevated VIX. |
| **Precious Metals** | **Bearish** | Strong US Dollar and rising real yields are major headwinds, overpowering safe-haven demand. |
| **Energy** | **Strongly Bearish** | Massive crude oil inventory build signals weak demand. |
| **FX (vs USD)** | **Mixed** | RBA hawkishness supports AUD; ECB/BoJ neutrality and strong DXY pressure EUR/JPY. |

## Instrument-Specific Bias & Narrative

| Instrument | Ticker | Bias Score | Bias | Narrative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| E-mini S&P 500 | ES | +3 | **Bullish** | Modest bullish bias driven by narrowing credit spreads, rising SOX, and steepening yield curve. Elevated VIX (>20) indicates risk-off sentiment that partially offsets bullish factors. |
| E-mini NASDAQ 100 | NQ | -1 | **Bearish** | Faces headwinds from rising real yields (major weight 3) and risk-off VIX, offset by strong SOX performance. The tug-of-war between tech strength and rising yields creates a slightly bearish tilt. |
| E-mini Dow Jones | YM | +3 | **Bullish** | Benefits from steepening yield curve (bullish for cyclicals/banks), narrowing credit spreads, and rising DXY. Risk-off VIX is a headwind but outweighed by positive factors for value/cyclical stocks. |
| E-mini Russell 2000 | RTY | +1 | **Bullish** | Slight bullish bias from narrowing credit spreads (critical for small caps) and steepening curve. Rising real yields and risk-off VIX are headwinds, creating a cautiously bullish stance. |
| Gold | GC | -1 | **Bearish** | Faces significant headwinds from rising real yields and strengthening DXY. Strong ETF inflows and risk-off VIX provide support but are insufficient to overcome the dual headwinds. |
| Silver | SI | 0 | **Neutral** | Caught between bearish forces (rising real yields, strong DXY) and bullish industrial demand signals (rising SOX). The balance creates a neutral stance. |
| Crude Oil | CL | -5 | **Bearish** | Strong bearish pressure from massive inventory build (+8.5M barrels) and rising DXY. Stable growth and geopolitical risk provide no offset. Clear bearish bias. |
| Australian Dollar | 6A | +1 | **Bullish** | Benefits from RBA's hawkish rate hike, but faces headwind from rising DXY. China growth stable. Slight bullish tilt from rate differential. |
| Euro | M6E | -2 | **Bearish** | Faces bearish pressure from rising DXY and rising US real yields relative to Europe. ECB on hold provides no support. Modest bearish bias. |
| Japanese Yen | 6J | -3 | **Bearish** | Faces bearish pressure from rising DXY and widening US-Japan yield differential. Risk-off VIX provides some safe-haven support but is insufficient. Bearish bias. |
