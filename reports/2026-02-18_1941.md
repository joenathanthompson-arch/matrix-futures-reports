## Instrument Bias Scores

### Commodities

#### GC (Gold Futures)
- **Score:** +3
- **Signal:** BULLISH
- **Confidence:** 7/10

Gold receives strong support from dovish Fed policy, weak US Dollar, and continued inflows into gold ETFs. The January 2026 ETF inflows of approximately $19 billion mark the strongest monthly inflow on record, pushing total AUM and holdings to all-time highs. Real yields remain flat but the combination of falling volatility and narrowing credit spreads creates a favorable environment for precious metals.

**Key Drivers:**
- Dovish Fed stance (94.1% hold probability)
- Weak USD (DXY showing downward momentum)
- Record gold ETF inflows ($19B in January)

#### SI (Silver Futures)
- **Score:** +3
- **Signal:** BULLISH
- **Confidence:** 6/10

Silver tracks gold's bullish bias but with slightly lower confidence due to its hybrid nature as both a precious and industrial metal. The flat copper price signals mixed industrial demand, tempering silver's upside potential compared to gold. However, the spillover from gold ETF demand and weak dollar provide solid support.

**Key Drivers:**
- Gold strength spillover
- Weak USD support
- Flat copper indicating mixed industrial demand

#### CL (WTI Crude Oil)
- **Score:** 0
- **Signal:** NEUTRAL
- **Confidence:** 5/10

Crude oil faces conflicting signals. The massive 8.5 million barrel inventory build in the week ending February 6 creates significant bearish pressure. However, this is partially offset by weak USD support and stable geopolitical conditions. US-Iran tensions remain elevated but diplomatic channels are open, preventing a major risk premium from developing.

**Key Drivers:**
- Large inventory build (-1): 8.5M barrels
- Weak USD support (+1)
- Stable geopolitical risk (0)

---

### Equity Indices

#### ES (S&P 500 Futures)
- **Score:** +4
- **Signal:** BULLISH
- **Confidence:** 7/10

The S&P 500 benefits from a strong macroeconomic backdrop. Narrowing credit spreads (HY OAS at 2.94%) signal healthy corporate credit conditions, while the VIX falling from recent highs indicates improving risk appetite. The dovish Fed stance and weak dollar create favorable conditions for large-cap equities.

**Key Drivers:**
- Narrowing credit spreads (2.94%)
- Falling VIX (-3.40% to 19.61)
- Dovish Fed policy

#### NQ (NASDAQ 100 Futures)
- **Score:** +4
- **Signal:** BULLISH
- **Confidence:** 7/10

Tech-heavy NASDAQ receives additional support from strong semiconductor performance. The SOX index gained +0.96% to 8,214.35, up 57.67% over the past year and 46.36% over six months. Falling MOVE index (-6.76% to 64.19) indicates declining bond market volatility, which typically benefits growth stocks.

**Key Drivers:**
- Strong SOX performance (+57.67% YoY)
- Falling MOVE index (bond vol declining)
- Dovish Fed supporting growth stocks

#### YM (Dow Jones Futures)
- **Score:** +4
- **Signal:** BULLISH
- **Confidence:** 7/10

The Dow Jones Industrial Average benefits from steepening yield curve dynamics. The 2s10s spread at 0.62% represents significant steepening from previously inverted levels, historically favorable for cyclical and value-oriented stocks that dominate the Dow. Narrowing credit spreads further support this bullish outlook.

**Key Drivers:**
- Steepening yield curve (2s10s at 0.62%)
- Narrowing credit spreads
- Healthy corporate credit conditions

#### RTY (Russell 2000 Futures)
- **Score:** +5
- **Signal:** STRONG_BULLISH
- **Confidence:** 7/10

Small-cap equities receive the highest score among indices due to their sensitivity to credit conditions and yield curve dynamics. The double weighting on credit spreads in the methodology reflects small caps' reliance on credit markets, and current conditions are highly favorable. The steepening curve and narrowing spreads create an ideal environment for small-cap outperformance.

**Key Drivers:**
- Narrowing credit spreads (double weight)
- Steepening yield curve
- Dovish Fed benefiting rate-sensitive small caps

---

### Foreign Exchange

#### M6E (Euro Futures)
- **Score:** 0
- **Signal:** NEUTRAL
- **Confidence:** 6/10

The Euro faces mixed conditions. While the weak USD provides support, the ECB's neutral hold at 2.00% on February 5 offers no rate differential advantage. The EUR-USD rate differential remains wide in favor of the USD (ECB 2.00% vs Fed 3.50-3.75%), limiting Euro upside despite dollar weakness.

**Key Drivers:**
- ECB neutral hold (0)
- Wide rate differential favoring USD (-2 weight)
- Weak USD providing support (+1)

#### 6A (Australian Dollar Futures)
- **Score:** +2
- **Signal:** SLIGHT_BULLISH
- **Confidence:** 6/10

The Australian Dollar receives support from the RBA's hawkish rate hike on February 3, raising the cash rate 25 basis points to 3.85%. This narrows the rate differential with the USD, creating bullish momentum. However, slowing China growth (PMI at 49.3, in contraction) offsets some of this strength given Australia's trade relationship with China.

**Key Drivers:**
- RBA hawkish hike (+25 bps to 3.85%)
- Narrowing rate differential with USD
- Slowing China growth (-2 weight)

#### 6J (Japanese Yen Futures)
- **Score:** 0
- **Signal:** NEUTRAL
- **Confidence:** 6/10

The Japanese Yen faces neutral conditions. The BoJ held rates at 0.75% in January, maintaining the highest policy rate in three decades but offering no new hawkish catalyst. The wide rate differential with the USD (BoJ 0.75% vs Fed 3.50-3.75%) continues to limit Yen strength despite weak dollar conditions.

**Key Drivers:**
- BoJ neutral hold at 0.75%
- Wide rate differential (-2 weight)
- Weak USD providing support (+1)

## Macroeconomic Factor Analysis

### Monetary Policy

**Federal Reserve:** The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 94.1% probability of the Fed holding rates at 3.50-3.75% at the March 2026 FOMC meeting. This dovish stance, with no rate hikes priced in for the near term, supports risk assets and precious metals.

**ECB:** The European Central Bank held rates unchanged at 2.00% on February 5, 2026, reiterating that inflation is expected to stabilize at the 2% target. The neutral stance provides no new catalyst for the Euro.

**RBA:** The Reserve Bank of Australia delivered a hawkish surprise on February 3, raising rates 25 basis points to 3.85% in response to rising inflation. This marks a reversal from the easing cycle of 2025 and signals potential for further tightening.

**BoJ:** The Bank of Japan held rates at 0.75% in January 2026, the highest in three decades. While the hold was expected, market participants anticipate further hikes to 1% by mid-2026 based on inflation dynamics and wage growth.

### Market Indicators

**VIX (Volatility):** The VIX fell 3.40% to 19.61, moving below the 20 threshold that typically signals elevated risk aversion. This decline indicates improving risk appetite and supports equity markets.

**Credit Spreads:** High-yield credit spreads (BAMLH0A0HYM2) stand at 2.94% as of February 17, showing continued narrowing from higher levels. Tight spreads indicate healthy corporate credit conditions and low default expectations.

**SOX (Semiconductors):** The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 0.96% to 8,214.35, maintaining strong momentum with gains of 57.67% over the past year. This tech sector strength supports NASDAQ performance.

**MOVE Index:** Bond market volatility fell 6.76% to 64.19, down 20.28% over six months. Declining bond volatility typically supports growth stocks and rate-sensitive assets.

**Yield Curve:** The 2s10s spread stands at 0.62%, representing significant steepening from the inverted levels of 2023. A steepening curve historically favors cyclical stocks and small caps.

### Currency and Commodities

**US Dollar (DXY):** The dollar index shows weakness, providing tailwinds for commodities and non-USD currencies. This weakness supports gold, silver, and commodity-linked currencies.

**Copper:** Copper prices remain flat at $5.78/lb, showing slight weakness over the past week (-0.14%) and month (-2.02%) but strong year-over-year gains (+25.21%). The flat short-term performance signals mixed industrial demand.

**Oil Inventories:** The EIA reported a massive 8.5 million barrel build in crude inventories for the week ending February 6, pushing total stocks to 428.8 million barrels. This large build creates bearish pressure on oil prices.

**Gold ETF Flows:** Global gold ETFs recorded approximately $19 billion in net inflows in January 2026, marking the strongest monthly inflow on record. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) alone attracted $3.2 billion. This demand supports gold prices.

### Growth and Risk

**GDPNow:** The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow estimate remains stable, indicating steady economic growth without overheating concerns.

**Geopolitical Risk:** US-Iran tensions remain elevated with ongoing nuclear negotiations, but diplomatic channels are open. Oil markets show some risk premium but no major escalation is priced in. Russia-Ukraine conflict continues without significant new developments.

## Key Drivers Summary

1. **Dovish Fed stance supporting risk assets and precious metals:** With a 94.1% probability of holding rates, the Fed's dovish posture removes a key headwind for equities and gold.

2. **Falling VIX and narrowing credit spreads indicating healthy risk appetite:** The VIX decline to 19.61 and credit spreads at 2.94% signal improving risk sentiment and healthy corporate credit conditions.

3. **Strong semiconductor performance and steepening yield curve favoring equities:** SOX strength (+57.67% YoY) and curve steepening (2s10s at 0.62%) create favorable conditions for equity markets, particularly tech and small caps.
