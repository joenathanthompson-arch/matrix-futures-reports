# Matrix Futures Daily Bias Report

**Date:** 2026-02-13

**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Overall Market Bias

The overall market bias is **BULLISH** heading into the session. This is driven by a confluence of factors including a weakening US Dollar, tightening credit spreads, and a steepening yield curve, which collectively create a supportive environment for risk assets. While equity indices and commodities show clear bullish signals, rising volatility in both equity (VIX) and bond (MOVE) markets warrants a degree of caution. Geopolitical tensions are also elevated, providing a tailwind for safe-haven assets like gold.

## 2. Asset Class Bias

The bias across the three major asset classes is predominantly bullish, with Indices showing the strongest conviction.

| Asset Class | Bias           |
| :---------- | :------------- |
| Indices     | **BULLISH**    |
| Commodities | **BULLISH**    |
| FX          | **SLIGHT_BULLISH** |

## 4. Key Drivers

Four primary macroeconomic factors are shaping the current market landscape:

> 1.  **Weak USD:** A falling US Dollar is providing broad support for commodities and risk assets globally.
> 2.  **Tight Credit Conditions:** Narrowing high-yield credit spreads indicate a healthy credit market, which is particularly favorable for equities and especially small-capitalization stocks (Russell 2000).
> 3.  **Geopolitical Tensions:** Heightened geopolitical risk, particularly involving the US and Iran, is increasing the appeal of traditional safe-haven assets like gold.
> 4.  **Rising Volatility:** A recent spike in both the VIX (equity volatility) and MOVE (bond volatility) indices suggests an undercurrent of investor anxiety, which could temper upside momentum in risk assets.
