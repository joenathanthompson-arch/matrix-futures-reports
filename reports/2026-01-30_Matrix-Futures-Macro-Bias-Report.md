**Author:** Manus AI

## I. Executive Summary

This report provides a quantitative daily macro bias for 10 key futures instruments across commodities, equity indices, and FX. The bias is derived from a weighted model of 18+ macroeconomic factors, designed to provide a directional edge for discretionary traders.

Today’s analysis reveals a **bullish bias for commodities and FX**, driven by significant US Dollar weakness, central bank policy divergence, and supportive credit conditions. The equity index bias is more subdued at **slight bullish**, reflecting a tension between strong technology sector performance and broader market uncertainty. Key drivers include a hawkish turn from the RBA and BoJ, strong inflows into gold ETFs, and a continued steepening of the yield curve.

## IV. Key Macro Drivers

*   **US Dollar Weakness:** The US Dollar Index (DXY) continues its decline, falling over 10% year-over-year. This broad-based weakness provides a significant tailwind for commodities and foreign currencies.
*   **Central Bank Divergence:** The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Japan are signaling further monetary tightening, with the RBA expected to hike rates next week. This contrasts with the Federal Reserve's neutral stance, creating clear divergence that supports the AUD and JPY.
*   **Supportive Credit Conditions:** High-yield credit spreads continue to narrow, indicating a healthy risk appetite in the market. This, combined with a steepening 2s10s yield curve, is particularly supportive of risk assets like equities, with a notable positive impact on the small-cap Russell 2000.
