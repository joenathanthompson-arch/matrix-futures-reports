## Executive Summary

The overall market bias is **BULLISH** for indices and commodities, while **NEUTRAL** for FX. Key drivers include a dovish Federal Reserve stance and narrowing credit spreads, which are supportive of risk assets. However, a strengthening US dollar is creating headwinds for commodities and foreign currencies. Growth expectations remain strong, although revised slightly lower, which is particularly supportive of cyclical assets.

## Key Macro Drivers

*   **Dovish Fed Stance & Credit Spreads:** A dovish hold from the Federal Reserve combined with narrowing high-yield credit spreads is providing a strong tailwind for risk assets, particularly equities. This indicates improving credit conditions and a supportive monetary policy backdrop.
*   **Strong but Slowing Growth:** The latest GDPNow reading of 4.2% indicates robust economic growth, which is beneficial for cyclical assets like industrial commodities and value-oriented equities. The recent downward revision, however, suggests the pace of growth may be moderating.
*   **Rising US Dollar:** The strengthening US Dollar Index (DXY) is acting as a headwind for commodities priced in dollars and for foreign currencies. This is a key factor tempering the bullish outlook for gold and silver.
