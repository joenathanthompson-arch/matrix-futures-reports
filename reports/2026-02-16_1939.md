## Overall Bias

The overall market bias is **BULLISH**, driven by broad strength across all asset classes. Key drivers include persistent USD weakness, narrowing credit spreads creating a favorable environment for equities (particularly small caps), and a risk-off sentiment (VIX > 20) providing support for safe-haven assets like gold.

## Key Drivers & Narrative

1.  **USD Weakness:** The continued decline in the U.S. Dollar is a primary catalyst, providing a tailwind for commodities and risk assets globally. The DXY is down 2.29% over the past month and 9.08% over the past year.
2.  **Favorable Credit Conditions:** High-yield option-adjusted spreads have narrowed to 2.92%, indicating low perceived risk in the corporate bond market. This is highly supportive of equities, especially small-cap stocks which are more sensitive to credit conditions.
3.  **Risk-Off Sentiment:** Despite the bullishness in equities, the VIX remains elevated at 20.60. This suggests underlying investor caution, which is channeling flows into traditional safe havens like Gold.

## Data Quality

- **Stale Sources:** Several key data points from FRED (DFII10, T10Y2Y, BAMLH0A0HYM2) were last updated on February 12th or 13th.
- **Fallbacks Used:** Real-time 10-Year TIPS yield was sourced from CNBC as a fallback to ensure the most current data was used for real yield calculations.
- **Proxies Used:** Gold ETF flows were proxied based on market sentiment and price action. China's growth was proxied using the strong performance of copper.
