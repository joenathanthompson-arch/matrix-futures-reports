## Market Commentary

### Equity Indices

**Bullish bias across all major US equity indices**, with **Russell 2000 (RTY)** showing the strongest conviction at **+2.9**. The bullish stance is driven by:

- **Narrowing credit spreads** (2.84% HY OAS near historical lows) indicating healthy risk appetite
- **Strong US manufacturing expansion** (ISM PMI at 52.6, highest in 3+ years)
- **Rising semiconductor sector** (SOX up 5.84% over 1 month)
- **Steepening yield curve** (2s10s at +0.64%) suggesting improving growth expectations

**Risk factors:** Elevated VIX at 20.60 and rising MOVE index (bond volatility up 15.32% over 1 month) suggest some caution, but not enough to override the bullish macro backdrop.

### Commodities

**Mixed picture** with energy showing slight bullish bias while metals are neutral to bearish:

- **Crude Oil (CL) +0.9 BULLISH:** Despite bearish inventory build (+8.5M barrels), weak USD and credit spread support provide modest bullish bias
- **Gold (GC) -0.6 BEARISH:** Paradoxically bearish despite record ETF inflows ($19bn) due to offsetting factors like narrowing credit spreads and stable real yields
- **Silver (SI) 0.0 NEUTRAL:** Caught between gold ETF strength and weak China PMI
- **Copper (HG) -0.4 BEARISH:** Weak China PMI (-1.5 contribution) outweighs strong US PMI

### FX Markets

**Strong bearish bias on both Euro (6E) and Yen (6J)** driven primarily by:

- **Weak USD** (DXY down 2.42% over 1 month) creates inverse pressure on USD pairs
- **Japanese Yen (6J) -3.4 BEARISH:** Strongest conviction in the entire report, driven by weak USD (-2.0), narrowing credit spreads (-0.8), and steepening curve (-0.8)
- **Euro (6E) -2.2 BEARISH:** Similar dynamics with weak USD (-2.0) and risk-off VIX (-0.5)

**Note:** The bearish bias on these FX instruments reflects **strength in the respective currencies (JPY and EUR) against USD**, not weakness. This is due to the inverse relationship where a falling DXY (weak USD) creates upward pressure on EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs.

## Risk Disclosures

**This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.** Bias scores are derived from quantitative macro factor analysis and do not account for:

- Intraday price action or technical levels
- Geopolitical events or news catalysts
- Earnings reports or company-specific factors
- Market microstructure or liquidity conditions

**Signal Decay:** Macro-based bias scores have a typical validity window of 1-5 trading sessions. Scores should be re-evaluated as new macro data becomes available.

**Past performance is not indicative of future results.** Trading futures involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors.

## Methodology Notes

Bias scores are calculated using a weighted factor model where each instrument has specific sensitivities to macro factors. For full methodology details, see [Macro_Bias_Scorer_Reference.md](../../docs/Macro_Bias_Scorer_Reference.md).

**Factor Scoring:**
- Each macro factor receives a score of -1 (bearish), 0 (neutral), or +1 (bullish)
- Instrument-specific weights are applied to each factor
- Final bias score = Σ (factor_score × instrument_weight)

**Thresholds:**
- ±5 bps for real yields (flat vs. rising/falling)
- VIX > 20 = risk-off, VIX < 15 = risk-on
- PMI > 50 = expansion, PMI < 50 = contraction
