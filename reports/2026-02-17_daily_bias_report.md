## Executive Summary

All three asset classes show **BULLISH** bias with broad-based support from weak USD conditions, favorable credit markets, and central bank policy divergence. The standout signal is **Japanese Yen (6J)** with a +6 score (STRONG_BULLISH) driven by BoJ's hawkish pivot and safe-haven flows. Small caps (RTY) lead equity indices at +5, benefiting from tight credit spreads. Crude oil remains the weakest (+1) due to massive inventory builds offsetting geopolitical risk premiums.

## Top 3 Macro Drivers

### 1. **Weak USD Supporting All Asset Classes**
The US Dollar Index (DXY) is down 9% year-over-year and trading near 97, providing tailwinds for commodities, equities, and non-USD currencies. This broad-based USD weakness is the primary cross-asset theme.

### 2. **Credit Conditions Remain Favorable**
High-yield credit spreads (BAMLH0A0HYM2) are at 2.94%, near historic lows and in a narrowing trend. This indicates strong credit conditions and supports risk assets, particularly small caps (RTY) which are highly sensitive to credit availability.

### 3. **Central Bank Divergence Favoring Non-USD Currencies**
While the Fed remains on hold (92.1% probability of no change per CME FedWatch), both the RBA and BoJ are in tightening cycles. The RBA raised rates by 25bps on February 4, and the BoJ raised in December 2025 with the IMF urging continued hikes. This policy divergence creates favorable rate differentials for AUD and JPY.

### Scoring Methodology
Bias scores are calculated using a weighted factor model based on the **Macro Bias Scorer Reference** document. Each instrument has 7-8 factors with weights ranging from 1x to 2x based on relevance. Raw scores (-1, 0, +1) are multiplied by weights and summed to produce the final bias score. Confidence levels reflect data freshness, factor alignment, and signal clarity.
