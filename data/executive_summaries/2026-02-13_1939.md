## Data Quality Notes
All primary data sources were available and up-to-date. No fallbacks were used.

## Asset Class Overview
- **Commodities:** BULLISH - Broad USD weakness and strong ETF inflows into gold are providing a tailwind for the complex, even with a large crude inventory build.
- **Indices:** BULLISH - Narrowing credit spreads and a steepening yield curve are creating a favorable environment for equities, particularly for value and small-cap stocks.
- **FX:** BULLISH - Clear policy divergence is the main theme, with the hawkish RBA and BoJ stances contrasting with the Fed's neutral hold, providing strong support for AUD and JPY against the dollar.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by a weaker US dollar and continued strong inflows into gold-backed ETFs. With real yields remaining stable, the path of least resistance for gold appears to be higher. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver also has a slight bullish bias (+2), moving in tandem with gold due to shared drivers like USD weakness and ETF inflows. However, the flat performance of copper, an industrial metal, tempers the conviction for a stronger bullish move. Recommended approach: MEAN_REVERSION (6/10).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil is neutral (0) as conflicting factors create a balanced outlook. A significant build in weekly inventories is bearish for prices, but this is being offset by broad-based US dollar weakness, which makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for foreign buyers. Recommended approach: RANGE (5/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 has a slight bullish bias (+2). The primary driver is the improvement in credit conditions, as indicated by narrowing high-yield spreads. This suggests a healthy risk appetite in the market, providing a supportive backdrop for large-cap equities. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 shows a slight bullish bias (+1). While the strong performance of the semiconductor sector (SOX) is a positive leading indicator for tech, rising bond market volatility (MOVE index) is a headwind that reduces conviction. Recommended approach: MEAN_REVERSION (6/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones has a bullish bias (+3). The combination of a steepening 2s10s yield curve and narrowing credit spreads is particularly favorable for the value and cyclical stocks that dominate the Dow. This suggests a rotation towards more economically sensitive names. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 shows a bullish bias (+4), making it one of the more constructive index setups. Small-cap stocks are highly sensitive to credit conditions, and the significant narrowing of credit spreads provides a strong tailwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro has a slight bullish bias (+1) against the US dollar, almost entirely due to the broad weakness in the greenback. With both the Fed and ECB on a neutral hold, the rate differential is stable, offering little independent direction for the currency pair. Recommended approach: FADE (5/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar has a bullish bias (+3). The primary driver is the hawkish surprise from the Reserve Bank of Australia, which hiked rates while the Fed remains on hold. This widening rate differential, combined with general USD weakness, provides a strong bullish case for the AUD. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen has a strong bullish bias (+5). This is the highest conviction signal, driven by a confluence of factors. The Bank of Japan is maintaining a hawkish stance, the rate differential with the US is narrowing, and the US dollar is broadly weak. This creates a powerful trifecta for JPY strength (and USD/JPY weakness). Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (8/10).

## Key Macro Themes
- **Broad-Based USD Weakness:** The US Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen significantly over the past month, providing a tailwind for almost all other asset classes.
- **Improving Credit Conditions:** High-yield credit spreads continue to narrow, signaling increased risk appetite and a healthy corporate credit market, which is supportive for equities.
- **Central Bank Policy Divergence:** The Fed's neutral stance is now being contrasted by hawkish moves from the RBA and hawkish signals from the BoJ, creating clear opportunities in FX markets.

## Watch List
