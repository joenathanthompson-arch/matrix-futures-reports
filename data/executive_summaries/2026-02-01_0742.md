- **Indices:** BULLISH - All four major US indices show a bullish bias, with the Nasdaq 100 leading the way on the back of falling real yields and strong semiconductor performance.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** BULLISH (+4) - Gold shows a bullish bias, primarily driven by significantly falling real yields (+4 weighted score) and continued ETF inflows (+1). A rising US dollar (-1) provides a headwind, but the overall picture remains supportive. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**SI (Silver):** BULLISH (+3) - Silver has a bullish bias, benefiting from the same tailwinds as gold, including falling real yields (+2) and a weaker growth narrative (+1). Rising copper prices (+1) also provide support. Recommended approach: MEAN_REVERSION (7/10).

**CL (Crude):** SLIGHT_BULLISH (+1) - Crude oil has a slight bullish bias. A draw in inventories (+1) and rising geopolitical risk (+1) are supportive, but a strengthening USD (-1) and stable growth narrative (0) are limiting factors. Recommended approach: RANGE (6/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** BULLISH (+3) - The S&P 500 shows a bullish bias, driven by falling real yields (+4 weighted score) and narrowing credit spreads (+1). A rising VIX (-1) and strengthening USD (-1) are minor headwinds. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq):** STRONG_BULLISH (+5) - The Nasdaq 100 has a strong bullish bias, as it is the most sensitive to falling real yields (+4 weighted score). Strong performance in the semiconductor sector (SOX) (+1) and falling rate volatility (MOVE) (+1) are also key drivers. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (8/10).

**YM (Dow):** BULLISH (+3) - The Dow Jones shows a bullish bias, supported by falling real yields (+2), narrowing credit spreads (+1), and a steepening yield curve (+1). The stable growth narrative (0) is a neutral factor. Recommended approach: MEAN_REVERSION (7/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** BULLISH (+4) - The Russell 2000 has a bullish bias, benefiting from narrowing credit spreads (+2 weighted score) and a steepening yield curve (+1). The stable growth narrative (0) is also supportive for small caps. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**M6E (Euro):** NEUTRAL (-1) - The Euro is neutral with a slight bearish tilt. A strengthening USD (-1) is the primary driver. The ECB's neutral stance (0) and stable Eurozone growth (0) are not providing any clear direction. Recommended approach: RANGE (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** NEUTRAL (0) - The Australian Dollar is neutral. A hawkish RBA (+1) and widening rate differentials (+1) are supportive, but slowing growth in China (-2 weighted score) and a stronger USD (-1) are significant headwinds. Recommended approach: RANGE (5/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** NEUTRAL (-1) - The Japanese Yen is neutral with a slight bearish tilt. A strengthening USD (-1) is the main driver, with the BoJ's neutral stance (0) and stable rate differentials (0) offering no counter-pressure. Recommended approach: RANGE (6/10).

## Key Macro Themes
- **Falling Real Yields:** The drop in real yields is a major tailwind for gold and long-duration assets like tech stocks.
- **USD Strength:** The US Dollar is showing broad strength, which is a headwind for commodities and foreign currencies.
- **Mixed Growth Signals:** While US growth remains stable, China's economy is showing signs of slowing, creating a mixed picture for global growth.

## Watch List
- **RBA Meeting (Feb 3):** The market is pricing in a 25bps hike, but any deviation could cause volatility in the AUD.
- **EIA Weekly Report (Feb 4):** Continued draws in oil inventories could provide a further boost to crude prices.
- **US CPI/NFP:** Upcoming inflation and jobs data will be critical for the Fed's next move.
