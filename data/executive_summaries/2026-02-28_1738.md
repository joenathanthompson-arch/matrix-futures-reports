# Executive Summary - February 28, 2026 | 17:38 EST

## Data Quality Notes

Two FRED data series carry minor staleness flags: DFII10 (10-year real yields, last observation Feb 26) and BAMLH0A0HYM2 (HY OAS credit spreads, last observation Feb 26), both two business days old. The trend direction is clear and consistent in both cases, so confidence reductions are minimal (1 point each where applicable). VIX intraday levels were cross-referenced against Investing.com VX futures data (+4.02% on the session) to confirm the CBOE Feb 27 close of 19.86 remains directionally valid. All other data sources are fresh as of Feb 27–28, 2026.

**CRITICAL MACRO EVENT:** The United States conducted military strikes against Iran on February 28, 2026. This is a live geopolitical shock event. VIX surged +6.61% to 19.86, MOVE index spiked +14.79% to 73.38, and safe-haven flows are active. All scores reflect this event.

## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** BULLISH — Gold and silver benefit from safe-haven demand and falling real yields; crude oil is bearish on fundamentals (massive inventory build) despite geopolitical risk premium.
- **Indices:** MIXED — Falling real yields provide a structural tailwind, but rising VIX, widening credit spreads, and geopolitical uncertainty cap upside. Only ES and NQ are slight bullish; YM and RTY are neutral.
- **FX:** BULLISH — All three FX instruments carry positive bias. JPY is the standout strong bullish driven by BoJ hawkishness, narrowing rate differentials, and safe-haven demand. EUR and AUD benefit from DXY weakness.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold carries a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH, confidence 7/10), driven by three converging tailwinds: falling 10-year real yields (DFII10 at 1.74%, down 6 basis points over five days), a weakening US dollar (DXY -0.60% YTD, -8.96% over one year), and surging safe-haven demand following US military strikes on Iran today. Gold ETF flows remain strongly positive — January 2026 saw +120 tonnes of global inflows, and GLD attracted $276M in inflows last week alone, with spot gold near $5,230 and up 7.6% in February. The only headwind is the accelerating GDPNow estimate (3.0% Q1 2026), which reduces the growth-scare safe-haven premium slightly. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10). Signal decay risk is low as geopolitical and yield dynamics are likely to persist.

**SI (Silver):** Silver scores bullish (+4, BULLISH, confidence 6/10), benefiting from the same precious metals tailwinds as gold — falling real yields, weak DXY, and safe-haven demand — while also receiving support from rising copper prices (+3.2% over the week, +15.5% over three months), which validates the industrial demand component. The hybrid precious/industrial nature of silver creates some conflicting signals: risk-off sentiment from the Iran strike is a headwind for the industrial demand story, while the precious metals bid is a tailwind. On balance, the precious metals correlation dominates given the current geopolitical backdrop. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with reduced size given the hybrid nature (6/10).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil carries a slight bearish bias (-3, SLIGHT_BEARISH, confidence 7/10). The fundamental picture is overwhelmingly bearish: the EIA reported a massive +16.0 million barrel crude inventory build for the week ending February 20, 2026 — one of the largest single-week builds since 2010 — pushing commercial stocks to 435.8 million barrels. GDPNow's 3.0% Q1 growth estimate is scored as accelerating, which under the methodology is bearish for crude (supply-side model). The sole bullish offset is the Iran geopolitical risk premium (+1 for geopolitical risk, +1 for DXY weakness), but this is insufficient to overcome the bearish fundamentals. The Iran strike creates a wildcard: Strait of Hormuz disruption risk could rapidly flip this score to bullish if supply disruptions materialize. Traders should monitor closely. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT given the conflicting signals (7/10 conviction on the bearish fundamental case, but geopolitical tail risk warrants caution).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 E-mini scores slight bullish (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH, confidence 6/10). The primary bullish driver is falling real yields (DFII10 -6bps, weighted 2x), which provides a structural discount-rate tailwind for equities. The DXY weakness is also mildly supportive. However, three headwinds cap the upside: VIX direction is rising (Iran strike), HY OAS credit spreads are widening (+12bps over the week to 2.98%), and the GDPNow acceleration is scored as a slight negative under the methodology. The net result is a modest bullish lean with elevated uncertainty. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Wait for initial balance to form before committing to direction given the geopolitical uncertainty.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** Nasdaq 100 scores slight bullish (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH, confidence 6/10), identical to ES in score but with a different composition. The 2x-weighted real yields factor provides the same structural tailwind (+4 weighted), and DXY weakness adds +1. The headwinds are SOX semiconductor index weakness (-1.21% on the day, -2.28% over the month), MOVE index surging (+14.79%, signaling rate volatility), and GDPNow acceleration. NQ is the highest-beta index and most sensitive to rate volatility — the MOVE surge is particularly concerning for duration-sensitive tech names. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT with half-size on first entry per methodology guidance (6/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones E-mini scores neutral (0, NEUTRAL, confidence 5/10). The bullish factors (real yields falling, DXY weak) are offset by the 2x-weighted growth narrative (accelerating GDPNow is bearish for YM under the methodology, as it reduces the case for Fed easing) and widening credit spreads. The 2s10s yield curve is flat at 0.59-0.60%, providing no directional signal. YM is the lower-beta, more defensive index and is less impacted by rate volatility than NQ, but the neutral score reflects balanced macro forces. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (5/10). No clear directional edge; better to sit out or trade the range.

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Russell 2000 scores neutral (-1, NEUTRAL, confidence 5/10). The small-cap index is most sensitive to credit conditions, and the widening HY OAS credit spreads (weighted 2x in the RTY model) are the dominant headwind, contributing -2 to the score. The 2x-weighted GDPNow acceleration also subtracts -2. The bullish offsets (real yields falling, DXY weak) are insufficient to overcome these headwinds. Small caps are also disproportionately exposed to domestic borrowing costs, and the Iran strike introduces additional uncertainty for risk appetite. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE or avoid (5/10). Credit spread widening is the key risk to watch.

**M6E (Micro Euro FX):** Euro FX scores bullish (+3, BULLISH, confidence 6/10). The primary driver is the rate differential dynamic: the Fed is expected to cut approximately 50 basis points in 2026 while the ECB held rates at 2.00% at its February 5 meeting and is expected to remain on hold through year-end. This narrowing of the Fed-ECB differential (weighted 2x) is bullish for EUR/USD. The DXY weakness (+1) reinforces this. Both the Fed and ECB are on neutral hold, contributing 0 each. Eurozone growth is stable. The Iran strike introduces some risk-off headwind, but EUR/USD tends to be less directly impacted by Middle East geopolitics than commodity currencies. EUR/USD support is seen near 1.1750 per ING analysis. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** Australian Dollar scores slight bullish (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH, confidence 5/10). The RBA delivered a hawkish surprise on February 3, hiking rates 25bps to 3.85% — the first hike in this cycle — and further hikes are expected (ANZ forecasts May hike to 4.10%). This has turned the AUD-USD rate differential positive for the first time, contributing +1 each for RBA stance and rate differential. Copper's strong performance (+3.2% week, +15.5% quarter) also supports AUD. However, the 2x-weighted risk sentiment factor is a significant headwind: AUD is a high-beta risk currency, and the Iran strike has triggered risk-off flows that typically pressure AUD. China growth is stable (mixed PMI signals, official NBS at 49.3 vs. Caixin at 50.3), contributing 0 to the 2x-weighted China factor. The net result is a modest bullish lean with elevated uncertainty. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (5/10). Risk-off from Iran strike could easily flip this to bearish intraday.

**6J (Japanese Yen):** Japanese Yen is the standout strong bullish call (+5, STRONG_BULLISH, confidence 7/10). Three powerful forces are aligned: (1) BoJ hawkishness — the BoJ raised rates to 0.75% in December 2025, held in January, and the most hawkish board member Takata is publicly calling for further hikes, contributing +2 (2x weight); (2) rate differential narrowing — with the Fed expected to cut ~50bps in 2026 and the BoJ hiking, the JPY-USD differential is narrowing meaningfully, contributing +2 (2x weight); (3) DXY weakness contributing +1. The Iran strike also provides a safe-haven bid for JPY, though the VIX at 19.86 (balanced range) means the risk mood factor is 0 rather than a full +1. USD/JPY is near the 155-157 range, and medium-term targets of 140-145 are being cited by major banks (State Street). Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10). This is the highest-conviction trade in the portfolio today.

## Key Macro Themes

The dominant theme today is the **geopolitical shock from US military strikes on Iran**, which has triggered a classic risk-off rotation: safe havens (gold, JPY, Treasuries) are bid, risk assets (equities, AUD, crude oil fundamentals) face headwinds, and rate volatility (MOVE +14.79%) is elevated. The second theme is the **structural tailwind from falling real yields** — DFII10 at 1.74% and declining provides a persistent bid for gold, silver, and duration-sensitive tech. The third theme is the **divergence between oil fundamentals and geopolitics**: the massive +16M barrel EIA inventory build is fundamentally bearish for crude, but the Iran strike introduces Strait of Hormuz disruption risk that could rapidly overwhelm the bearish fundamental case.

## Watch List

The following events could materially shift bias scores in the coming sessions: (1) **Iran response to US strikes** — any escalation involving the Strait of Hormuz would be strongly bullish CL and GC while bearish for indices; (2) **FOMC meeting March 18-19** — currently 92.6% probability of no change, but any shift in language could impact ES, NQ, and rate-sensitive instruments; (3) **EIA Weekly Petroleum Report (March 4)** — next release will confirm whether the +16M barrel build was a one-off or the start of a sustained oversupply trend; (4) **RBA next meeting** — further hike expectations for May could strengthen 6A; (5) **BoJ communications** — any hawkish signals would reinforce the strong bullish 6J call.
