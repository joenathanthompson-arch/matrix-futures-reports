## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** BULLISH — All three commodity instruments score bullish or better. Crude oil leads with a STRONG_BULLISH signal driven by the largest inventory draw in five months (-9M barrels). Gold and silver carry slight bullish bias from risk-off conditions and a slowing growth narrative.
- **Indices:** BULLISH — Three of four equity indices score slight bullish or better. Credit spreads narrowing and slowing growth (which the methodology scores as bullish for equities via the GDPNow factor) provide support. NQ is the outlier at NEUTRAL due to rising MOVE index and flat SOX.
- **FX:** MIXED — A three-way split: JPY is BULLISH on BoJ hawkish pivot and safe-haven demand; EUR is NEUTRAL with both central banks on hold; AUD is SLIGHT_BEARISH as China PMI below 50 and risk-off conditions outweigh the RBA's hawkish hike.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold carries a slight bullish bias (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH) heading into the session. The primary support comes from risk-off conditions with VIX elevated above 20 and rising, combined with a slowing GDPNow growth narrative that historically supports safe-haven demand. Real yields are flat (1.80%, within ±5bps of recent levels), providing a neutral backdrop rather than a headwind, while the USD is modestly rising on the 5-day basis which provides a small drag. Gold ETF flows are mixed this week — Reuters reported a $1.86 billion outflow from gold/precious metals funds on Feb 20, snapping a five-week inflow streak, which tempers conviction. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTENSION on rallies toward prior highs, or IB_BREAKOUT long on confirmed break above opening range. Confidence: 6/10. Signal decay: moderate — watch for real yields direction shift or VIX reversal.

**SI (Silver):** Silver scores slight bullish (+1, SLIGHT_BULLISH) but with lower conviction than gold. As a hybrid precious/industrial metal, silver benefits from the same risk-off and growth-slowing dynamics as gold, but copper's flat performance (day +0.45%, week -0.65%) removes the industrial demand confirmation that would push silver higher. The USD headwind is the same as for gold. With ETF flows mixed and copper not confirming an industrial demand surge, silver is best treated as a follower of gold rather than a leader. Recommended approach: WAIT_FOR_GOLD_CONFIRMATION — enter long only after GC shows clear directional conviction. Confidence: 5/10. Reduce size given conflicting signals.

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil is the standout instrument this session with a STRONG_BULLISH score (+5). The EIA weekly report released February 19 showed a 9.0 million barrel inventory draw for the week ending February 13 — the largest single-week draw in five months — bringing total crude stocks to 419.8 million barrels. This draw is scored at both the supply shock (weight 2) and inventory (weight 1) levels, contributing +3 weighted points. The slowing GDPNow (scored as bullish for oil via the growth narrative factor, weight 2) adds +2, and rising geopolitical risk (US-Iran tensions per Feb 20 news) adds +1. The only headwind is a modestly rising USD (-1). The EIA also noted stronger refinery demand as the driver of the draw. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long on opening range expansion, or PULLBACK_BUY on any early session dip. Confidence: 7/10.

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 E-mini carries a slight bullish bias (+1, SLIGHT_BULLISH) but with notable internal tension. Credit spreads narrowing from 2.95% to 2.86% HY OAS over the past week is a genuine positive signal for equities. However, the VIX rising above 20 (+2.27% today, +38% YTD) and the VIX direction score of -1 create a headwind. The net result is a marginal bullish lean. Real yields are flat (neutral), the Fed is firmly on hold (neutral), and the USD is slightly rising (small drag). The slowing GDPNow adds a point via the growth narrative factor. Pre-market futures show ES down about 0.28%, consistent with the muted bullish bias. Recommended approach: FADE_EARLY_WEAKNESS if price finds support at prior day's value area; avoid aggressive longs given VIX elevation. Confidence: 6/10.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 scores NEUTRAL (0) for this session, making it the weakest of the equity indices. The key differentiator from ES is the MOVE index, which surged +5.99% today to 68.03 — rising rate volatility is a direct headwind for duration-sensitive growth stocks. SOX is flat (day -0.50%, week +1.03%), providing no additional tailwind. Real yields are flat, which removes the most powerful bullish driver for NQ (falling real yields). With MOVE rising and SOX not confirming strength, NQ lacks the fundamental support needed for a directional bias. Pre-market NQ is down about 0.41%. Recommended approach: AVOID_DIRECTIONAL_BIAS — trade the range, fade extensions in both directions. Confidence: 5/10.

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones E-mini scores slight bullish (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH), performing better than NQ due to its lower sensitivity to rate volatility and higher weighting on growth and credit conditions. The slowing GDPNow (weight 2) contributes +2, credit spreads narrowing adds +1, and risk-off conditions add +1. The yield curve flattening (-1) and rising USD (-1) are the offsets. The Dow's value-oriented composition makes it more resilient to the MOVE index headwind that is weighing on NQ. Pre-market DJI is down about 0.54%, which may present a fade opportunity. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long if opening range holds above prior day's low; target prior day's high. Confidence: 6/10.

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 E-mini scores BULLISH (+3), the strongest equity signal in this report. The key driver is credit spreads narrowing (weight 2, contributing +2), which is the most important factor for small-cap stocks that rely heavily on high-yield credit markets for financing. The slowing growth narrative (weight 2, contributing +2) also supports the score per the methodology. The yield curve flattening (-1) and rising USD (-1) are partial offsets. Pre-market RTY is actually showing a small gain (+0.24%), the only major index in positive territory, which is consistent with the bullish score. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long on opening range expansion; RTY tends to lead when credit conditions are improving. Confidence: 6/10.

**M6E (Euro FX):** The Euro FX scores NEUTRAL (0) with balanced forces on both sides. Both the Fed and ECB are on hold — the Fed at 3.50-3.75% and the ECB at 2.00% deposit rate (held at the February 5 meeting). The rate differential is stable, providing no directional impulse. The USD is modestly rising today (headwind for EUR), while risk-off conditions (VIX >20) provide a slight offset. EUR/USD is trading near 1.1766, down 0.06% on the day, consistent with the neutral score. The ECB's hold was described as data-dependent, with Deutsche Bank forecasting rates on hold at 2% through 2026. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE — fade moves to extremes of recent range (1.17-1.19). Confidence: 5/10.

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar scores SLIGHT_BEARISH (-3), the only clearly bearish signal in this report. Despite the RBA's hawkish hike to 3.85% on February 3 (the first hike in the current cycle, bullish for AUD), two high-weight bearish factors dominate: China's official manufacturing PMI fell to 49.3 in January (below the 50 expansion threshold, weight 2, contributing -2), and risk-off conditions with VIX above 20 (weight 2, contributing -2). Australia's largest trade partner is in manufacturing contraction, and the global risk environment is deteriorating. The AUD rate differential now favors AUD over USD (3.85% vs 3.50-3.75%), but this is insufficient to overcome the China and risk-off headwinds. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLIES — sell strength toward resistance; avoid longs given the macro headwinds. Confidence: 7/10.

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen scores BULLISH (+4), the strongest FX signal and second strongest overall signal in this report. Three factors align bullishly: the BoJ's hawkish stance (weight 2, contributing +2) with an April rate hike widely expected per ex-board member commentary; the narrowing JPY-USD rate differential as the BoJ tightens while the Fed holds (weight 2, contributing +2); and risk-off conditions driving safe-haven demand for JPY (weight 1, contributing +1). The only offset is the modestly rising USD (-1). Note that 6J quotes are inverted — a bullish 6J score means USD/JPY is expected to fall. Japan's core inflation slowing to a 2-year low (reported Feb 20) introduces some uncertainty about the April hike timing, which is reflected in the 7/10 rather than 8/10 confidence. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long (long 6J = short USD/JPY) on opening range expansion; target prior session highs. Confidence: 7/10.

## Key Macro Themes

**Theme 1 — Energy Supply Tightness:** The 9-million-barrel crude inventory draw is the dominant macro event of the week. With the largest draw in five months and refinery demand rising, the oil supply picture has shifted meaningfully bullish. This supports CL directly and provides a secondary tailwind for inflation expectations, which could complicate the Fed's path.

**Theme 2 — Risk-Off Creep:** VIX has risen 38% year-to-date and is now above 20, with MOVE also elevated and rising. This is not a crisis-level risk-off, but it represents a sustained deterioration in risk appetite that benefits safe havens (gold, JPY) while creating headwinds for risk assets (equities, AUD). The geopolitical backdrop (US-Iran tensions, tariff uncertainty) is contributing.

**Theme 3 — Central Bank Divergence:** The BoJ's hawkish pivot (hiking in December 2025, April hike expected) stands in contrast to the Fed's neutral hold and the ECB's hold at 2%. This divergence is the primary driver of the BULLISH JPY signal and is the most structurally significant macro theme for FX markets in 2026.

## Watch List

The following upcoming events could shift bias materially:

- **Feb 20, 2026 (today):** Atlanta Fed GDPNow first Q1 2026 estimate — if significantly below Q4's 3.0%, could boost gold and JPY further while pressuring equities.
- **Feb 25, 2026:** Next EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report — confirmation of inventory draw trend would sustain CL bullish bias; a build would reverse it quickly.
- **Mar 5, 2026:** China Caixin Manufacturing PMI — key for 6A; a recovery above 50 would shift AUD bias toward neutral.
- **Mar 18-19, 2026:** FOMC Meeting — any shift in language toward cuts would be strongly bullish for equities and gold; any hawkish surprise would be bearish.
- **Mar 31, 2026:** Next FOMC meeting (currently 94% probability of hold) — watch for any evolution in cut probability.
