# Executive Summary - February 8, 2026 (19:35 EST)

## Data Quality Notes

Some FRED data sources are 2-3 days stale (DFII10 from Feb 5, BAMLH0A0HYM2 from Feb 5, T10Y2Y from Feb 6). Used CNBC US10YTIP as fallback for real yields verification. All other data sources are current as of Feb 8-9, 2026.

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities:** BULLISH - Weak USD and strong gold ETF inflows supporting precious metals. Copper strength reinforcing industrial demand. Oil inventories showing draws.

**Indices:** BULLISH - All four equity indices showing bullish bias. Tight credit conditions (HY OAS at 2.97%), falling VIX (-18.42%), and steepening yield curve creating favorable environment for equities. Small caps (RTY) particularly strong due to credit sensitivity.

**FX:** BULLISH - All three FX instruments showing bullish bias. Japanese Yen leading with strong bullish signal driven by BoJ policy normalization. Weak USD benefiting all foreign currencies.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by weak USD and strong gold ETF inflows continuing into 2026 (8th consecutive month of inflows). Real yields remain flat rather than falling, limiting upside momentum. However, the combination of USD weakness and sustained institutional demand through ETFs provides a constructive backdrop. Recommended approach: RANGE_FADE on pullbacks to key support levels (7/10 confidence).

**SI (Silver):** Silver displays a bullish bias (+3), benefiting from the alignment of precious metals demand (gold ETF flows) and industrial demand (copper strength up 28% YoY). The weak USD provides additional tailwind. Silver's dual nature as both precious and industrial metal makes it particularly attractive when both drivers align. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on strength above key resistance (7/10 confidence).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil shows a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by inventory draws (-3.5M barrels) and weak USD. However, the absence of supply shocks or geopolitical escalation limits upside potential. Growth remains stable rather than accelerating, capping demand expectations. Recommended approach: RANGE_FADE within established trading range (6/10 confidence).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 displays a bullish bias (+3), driven by tight credit conditions, falling VIX, and weak USD. Credit spreads at 2.97% near multi-year lows signal healthy risk appetite. The combination of low volatility and accommodative credit conditions creates a favorable environment for broad equity exposure. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on continuation of uptrend (7/10 confidence).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** Nasdaq shows a bullish bias (+3), supported by semiconductor strength (SOX +5.70% in latest session, up 59% YoY), falling bond volatility (MOVE down 33% YoY), and weak USD. Tech sector leadership remains intact with SOX strength confirming the trend. Lower rate volatility reduces discount rate uncertainty for growth stocks. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on tech strength continuation (7/10 confidence).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow displays a bullish bias (+3), benefiting from tight credit conditions, steepening yield curve (+0.72%), and weak USD. The steepening curve signals healthy economic expectations favoring cyclical and value-oriented Dow components. Credit conditions remain supportive. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on industrial strength (7/10 confidence).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Russell 2000 shows the strongest equity bias (+4), highly sensitive to credit conditions which remain exceptionally tight (HY OAS 2.97%). Small caps rely heavily on bank lending and high-yield markets, making them primary beneficiaries of narrow spreads. The steepening curve also supports small cap valuations. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT with conviction on credit-driven rally (7/10 confidence).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro shows a slight bullish bias (+1), primarily supported by weak USD. Both ECB and Fed remain on hold with no rate differential changes expected. Eurozone growth stable but not accelerating. The bullish bias is entirely USD-driven rather than EUR-specific strength. Recommended approach: RANGE_FADE with reduced conviction given lack of fundamental catalysts (5/10 confidence).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar displays a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by weak USD and copper strength (up 28% YoY). However, China growth remains stable rather than accelerating, limiting upside for this China-proxy currency. RBA remains on hold. The commodity link through copper provides some support. Recommended approach: RANGE_FADE within established range (6/10 confidence).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen shows a strong bullish bias (+5), driven by BoJ policy normalization and widening rate differentials favoring JPY. The BoJ's hawkish pivot toward policy tightening while the Fed remains on hold creates a powerful fundamental driver for JPY strength. Note that 6J quotes are inverted (higher = stronger JPY = weaker USD/JPY). This is the highest conviction FX trade. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on JPY strength continuation (7/10 confidence).

## Key Macro Themes

The dominant theme across all asset classes is **USD weakness** (DXY down to 97.55, continuing its 9.4% decline over the past year). This broad-based dollar weakness is lifting all boats across commodities, equities, and foreign currencies. Within equities, **credit conditions** remain exceptionally tight with HY OAS at 2.97% near multi-year lows, creating particularly favorable conditions for credit-sensitive small caps. The **BoJ policy normalization** story is the standout FX theme, creating the strongest directional signal in the entire report for Japanese Yen strength.

## Watch List

**Ongoing:** BoJ policy statements and rate decisions - critical for JPY directional bias given current strong bullish signal.
