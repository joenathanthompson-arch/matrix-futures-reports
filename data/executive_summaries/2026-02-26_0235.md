## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** MIXED — Gold and silver are firmly bullish on falling real yields and ETF inflows, but crude oil is deeply bearish following a massive +16.0MB inventory build (week ending Feb 20). The commodity bloc is split 2-1 bullish/bearish.
- **Indices:** BULLISH — All four index instruments score positive. The dominant driver is falling real yields (DFII10 at 1.78%, trending lower from ~2.0%). NQ reaches STRONG_BULLISH territory as semiconductors surge and rate volatility collapses. Three of four indices score BULLISH or higher, meeting the majority threshold.
- **FX:** BULLISH — All three FX instruments score positive. The RBA's surprise February hike to 3.85% drives 6A to BULLISH. Eurozone PMI at a 14-month high supports M6E. 6J benefits from BoJ's continued hiking path narrowing the JPY-USD rate differential.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold scores BULLISH (+3, confidence 8/10). The dominant driver is falling real yields — DFII10 has declined from approximately 2.0% to 1.78% in recent weeks, a clear trend that carries double weight in the gold model. Gold ETF inflows remain exceptional, with global funds attracting more than $18 billion year-to-date through February 20, pushing collective AUM to all-time highs. The only headwinds are the accelerating growth narrative (GDPNow 3.1%) and easing oil supply, both of which are modest offsets. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or TREND_FOLLOW on dips (8/10 conviction).

**SI (Silver):** Silver scores BULLISH (+3, confidence 7/10). Silver benefits from the same falling-real-yield environment as gold, while the copper surge (+3.96% weekly, +16.06% over three months) confirms the industrial demand side of the silver thesis. Gold ETF inflows provide a sympathetic tailwind. The accelerating growth narrative is a mild headwind, as strong growth can reduce safe-haven demand. Silver's hybrid precious/industrial nature is well-served by the current environment of falling rate volatility and rising copper. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT, noting silver's higher beta vs gold (7/10 conviction).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude scores BEARISH (-4, confidence 8/10). The EIA weekly report (week ending February 20) delivered a massive +16.0 million barrel crude inventory build, the largest in recent memory, pushing total commercial stocks to 435.8 million barrels. The oil supply model assigns double weight to supply conditions, and both the supply shock (-1×2) and inventory (-1×1) factors are negative. The accelerating GDPNow growth narrative (-1×2) is also bearish for oil in this model, as it signals demand is already priced in. Geopolitical risk (+1) provides a partial offset. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLIES or SHORT on strength; avoid long-side until inventory trend reverses (8/10 conviction).

**ES (S&P 500):** S&P 500 scores BULLISH (+4, confidence 8/10). Falling real yields carry double weight and are the primary driver, contributing +4 to the score alone. Credit spreads are narrowing (HY OAS at 2.97%, near historical lows), confirming benign financial conditions. The Fed remains on a neutral hold with 98% probability of no change at the March FOMC. The accelerating growth narrative is a mild offset in this model, but the combination of falling yields, tight credit, and a neutral Fed creates a supportive backdrop. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long; scale into any tariff-driven dips (8/10 conviction).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** Nasdaq scores STRONG_BULLISH (+5, confidence 8/10). This is the highest-conviction signal in today's report. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) closed at 8,467 (+1.62% session, +4.42% weekly), confirming the tech leadership theme. The MOVE index collapsed -4.35% on the session and -8.23% on the week, signaling that rate volatility is being wrung out of the market — a powerful tailwind for duration-sensitive tech. Falling real yields (double weight, +4) combine with rising SOX (+1) and falling MOVE (+1) to produce a clean, multi-factor bullish alignment. The accelerating growth narrative (-1) is the sole headwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long; note the methodology's guidance to use half-size on first entry given NQ's elevated beta (8/10 conviction).

**YM (Dow Jones):** Dow scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+2, confidence 7/10). The Dow's model places double weight on growth narrative, which is a headwind (accelerating growth = -2 in this model, as the Dow is more reflation/value-oriented and strong growth can mean higher-for-longer rates). However, falling real yields (+2), narrowing credit spreads (+1), and a steepening yield curve (+1) provide support. The curve steepening to +0.60% is particularly relevant for the Dow's financial and industrial components. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with reduced size; prefer ES or NQ for index exposure given stronger signals (7/10 conviction).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Russell 2000 scores BULLISH (+3, confidence 7/10). Credit spreads carry double weight in the RTY model, reflecting small caps' sensitivity to credit conditions. With HY OAS at 2.97% and narrowing, the credit environment is highly supportive. The steepening yield curve (+1) benefits small-cap financials and domestic lenders. Falling real yields (+2) provide a further tailwind. The accelerating growth narrative is a headwind (-2 double weight), but credit conditions dominate. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT; monitor credit spreads closely as the primary leading indicator for RTY (7/10 conviction).

**M6E (Micro Euro FX):** Euro scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+1, confidence 6/10). The primary driver is improving eurozone economic momentum — the February flash composite PMI rose to 51.9 (14-month high) and the manufacturing PMI hit a 44-month high of 50.8, signaling the eurozone's first genuine industrial recovery in years. Both the Fed and ECB are on neutral holds, leaving the rate differential stable at approximately -1.50% to -1.75% (EUR disadvantage). The DXY is flat, providing no directional impulse. The signal is modest given the rate differential headwind, but eurozone growth improvement is a genuine positive catalyst. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with small size; watch for ECB communication shifts that could widen the differential (6/10 conviction).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** AUD scores BULLISH (+3, confidence 7/10). The RBA's surprise 25bp rate hike to 3.85% on February 3 is the dominant driver, both through the hawkish stance score (+1) and the widening AUD-USD rate differential (+1, as AUD rates now exceed USD rates). Copper's strong uptrend (+3.96% weekly, +16.06% quarterly) provides commodity support. China's mixed PMI data (official 49.3, private 50.3) is a neutral factor, neither adding nor subtracting. Risk sentiment is balanced (VIX 17.93). The combination of a hawkish central bank, widening rate differential, and rising copper creates a solid bullish case. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or TREND_FOLLOW; monitor RBA communication for guidance on further hikes (7/10 conviction).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** Yen scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+2, confidence 6/10). The BoJ's continued hiking path is the primary driver — multiple policymakers have called for further rate increases, and ING forecasts the next hike in June 2026. The narrowing JPY-USD rate differential (BoJ hiking while Fed is on hold) contributes +2 to the score. However, the government's nomination of two new BoJ board members seen as dovish caused the yen to weaken on February 25, introducing uncertainty about the pace of normalization. The BoJ stance is scored neutral (0) to reflect this conflict. Note that 6J is quoted inversely — SLIGHT_BULLISH means bullish JPY, which corresponds to a declining USD/JPY (currently ~155.8). Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with reduced size; the dovish board nominee risk warrants caution (6/10 conviction).

## Key Macro Themes

Three dominant narratives are shaping today's bias scores. First, the falling real yield regime — DFII10 has declined from approximately 2.0% to 1.78% in recent weeks, and this single factor is the most powerful driver across the scorecard, contributing positively to gold, silver, all four equity indices, and providing a supportive backdrop for risk assets broadly. Second, the crude oil divergence — while the broader commodity complex is bullish, crude is deeply bearish following the largest weekly inventory build in recent memory (+16.0MB). This creates an unusual split within the commodity bloc and warrants caution on any energy-linked positions. Third, the tech/semiconductor momentum — the SOX index is at all-time highs (+16.17% YTD), the MOVE index is collapsing, and Nvidia's earnings (reported after the Feb 25 close) are driving pre-market futures activity. NQ's STRONG_BULLISH signal reflects a clean alignment of all key tech drivers.

---

## Watch List

The following events could shift bias scores materially before the next report:

- **Nvidia earnings reaction (pre-market, Feb 26):** Futures are wobbling after NVDA's after-hours report. A strong gap-up would reinforce NQ's STRONG_BULLISH signal; a gap-down could reduce SOX and NQ scores.
- **EIA Weekly Petroleum Report (Wednesday, Mar 4):** The +16.0MB build is the primary driver of CL's BEARISH signal. A reversal to a draw would shift CL toward neutral. Monitor closely.
- **BoJ board nominations (ongoing):** The appointment of dovish board members could reduce the BoJ hiking path confidence, potentially shifting 6J from SLIGHT_BULLISH to NEUTRAL.
- **Fed speakers (week of Feb 26):** Any deviation from the neutral hold narrative could shift the Fed stance score and cascade across all instruments.
- **US tariff developments:** The Supreme Court ruling against Trump tariffs is being contested with new tariff mechanisms. Escalation could spike geopolitical risk scores and shift CL, GC, and FX signals.
