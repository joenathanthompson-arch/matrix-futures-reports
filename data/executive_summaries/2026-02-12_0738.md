# Executive Summary - February 12, 2026 07:38 EST

## Data Quality Notes

Some FRED data sources (DFII10, BAMLH0A0HYM2, T10Y2Y) were 1-2 days stale. Used CNBC US10YTIP as fallback for real yields to ensure current pricing. All other sources are current as of February 12, 2026.

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities:** BULLISH - Precious metals supported by dovish Fed and weak USD, though crude oil faces headwinds from inventory builds.

**Indices:** BULLISH - Broad-based strength across all equity indices driven by dovish Fed stance, narrowing credit spreads, and falling volatility.

**FX:** BULLISH - Strong across the board as central bank divergence (BoJ/RBA tightening vs Fed dovish) drives foreign currency strength against weakening USD.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a bullish bias (+3), supported by the Fed's dovish hold stance and continued USD weakness. While real yields remain flat, geopolitical tensions (Greenland, tariffs) are driving safe-haven inflows into gold ETFs. The combination of a weakening dollar and rising geopolitical risk provides a solid foundation for gold prices. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on geopolitical headlines (7/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver displays a bullish bias (+4), benefiting from both its precious metal characteristics (weak USD, dovish Fed) and industrial demand signals (rising copper prices). The hybrid nature of silver positions it well in the current environment where both safe-haven demand and growth indicators are supportive. However, silver's dual nature also creates some uncertainty. Recommended approach: MOMENTUM_FOLLOW with copper confirmation (6/10).

**CL (WTI Crude):** Crude oil shows a slight bullish bias (+1), with conflicting signals creating a more cautious outlook. Geopolitical risk and USD weakness provide support, but the recent inventory build of 8.5 million barrels (largest in a year) is a significant bearish factor. Growth remains stable but not accelerating. The inventory overhang limits upside potential despite geopolitical premium. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE between support/resistance (5/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 exhibits a bullish bias (+4), driven by the Fed's dovish hold stance, narrowing credit spreads, and falling VIX (down 20% over five days). The combination of accommodative monetary policy expectations and improving risk sentiment creates a favorable environment for broad equity exposure. Real yields remain flat, removing a potential headwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on credit spread tightening (7/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 shows a bullish bias (+4), supported by dovish Fed policy, strong semiconductor performance (SOX up 9.47% over the month), and falling bond volatility (MOVE index down 4.96%). The tech-heavy index benefits from the growth-friendly environment and declining rate volatility. Flat real yields are particularly supportive for duration-sensitive tech stocks. Recommended approach: MOMENTUM_FOLLOW with SOX leadership (7/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones displays a bullish bias (+4), benefiting from the reflation trade as evidenced by the steepening yield curve (2s10s at 66bps). Narrowing credit spreads and dovish Fed policy support cyclical and value-oriented names that dominate the Dow. The curve steepening signals improving growth expectations, which favors the Dow's composition. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on curve steepening continuation (6/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 shows a strong bullish bias (+5), the highest among equity indices. Small caps are particularly sensitive to credit conditions, and the narrowing of high-yield spreads to 286bps (from 300+) is a powerful bullish signal. The dovish Fed and steepening curve further support domestically-focused small caps. This is the strongest equity signal in the current environment. Recommended approach: MOMENTUM_FOLLOW on credit spread narrowing (7/10).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro exhibits a bullish bias (+4) against the USD, driven primarily by the divergence in central bank stances. While the ECB is holding rates steady at 2.00%, the Fed's increasingly dovish posture (94% probability of hold but rising cut expectations) is narrowing the rate differential in favor of the Euro. The weak USD (down 2.08% over the month) provides additional support. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on Fed/ECB divergence (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar shows a strong bullish bias (+5), supported by multiple factors. The RBA's recent 25bp hike to 3.85% (with 75% probability of another hike by May) contrasts sharply with the Fed's dovish stance, creating a favorable rate differential. Rising copper prices (+0.34% today) and weak USD provide additional support. This is one of the strongest FX signals. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on RBA hawkishness (7/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen displays the strongest bullish bias (+6) across all instruments. The Bank of Japan's hawkish stance (potential rate hikes as early as March, up to 3 times in 2026) creates a powerful divergence against the dovish Fed. The ruling bloc's election victory supports continued tightening, and the government's concern about yen weakness adds political pressure for a stronger yen. Note that bullish 6J means bearish USD/JPY due to inverted quoting. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on BoJ policy divergence (8/10).

## Key Macro Themes

The dominant macro narrative is central bank policy divergence. The Federal Reserve's dovish hold stance (with dissent for cuts and rising market expectations for easing) stands in stark contrast to the hawkish postures of the Bank of Japan and Reserve Bank of Australia. This divergence is driving broad-based USD weakness and creating strong tailwinds for foreign currencies. The Fed's dovish tilt, combined with narrowing credit spreads and falling volatility (VIX down 20% over five days), is supporting risk assets across the board. Equity indices are benefiting from this accommodative backdrop, with small caps (RTY) showing particular strength due to their sensitivity to credit conditions.

The second key theme is the improving risk environment. Credit spreads have narrowed to 286bps from 300+ levels, the VIX has fallen sharply, and bond volatility (MOVE index) is declining. This combination signals increasing investor confidence and appetite for risk. The yield curve steepening (2s10s at 66bps) suggests markets are pricing in a soft landing scenario with stable growth and eventual Fed easing, which is particularly supportive for cyclical and value-oriented equities.

The third theme is the mixed commodity picture. Precious metals (gold and silver) are benefiting from geopolitical risk (Greenland tensions, tariff threats) and USD weakness, while crude oil faces headwinds from a significant inventory build despite geopolitical support. Industrial metals like copper are rising, signaling underlying growth resilience. This divergence within commodities reflects the complex interplay between safe-haven demand, growth expectations, and supply-demand dynamics.

## Watch List

**March 18-19 FOMC Meeting:** The next Fed meeting is 34 days away, and market expectations for rate cuts are building. Any shift in the Fed's forward guidance could significantly impact the current dovish narrative and USD weakness trend.

**BoJ March Meeting:** With markets pricing in potential rate hikes as early as March, the Bank of Japan's next decision will be critical for the JPY strength trade. Further hawkish signals could extend the 6J rally.

**RBA May Meeting:** Markets are pricing a 75% probability of another 25bp hike to 4.10% by May. Australian inflation data in Q1 will be crucial in determining whether the RBA continues its tightening cycle.

**Credit Spread Levels:** The narrowing of high-yield spreads to 286bps is a key support for risk assets, particularly small caps. Any reversal or widening would be an early warning signal for equity weakness.

**VIX Levels:** After falling 20% over five days to 17.39, the VIX is in the "balanced" range (15-20). A break below 15 would signal extreme complacency, while a move above 20 would indicate rising risk aversion.

**Oil Inventories:** The 8.5 million barrel build was the largest in a year. Next week's EIA report will be important to determine if this was a one-time event or the start of a bearish trend for crude oil.

**Geopolitical Developments:** Ongoing tensions around Greenland and tariff threats are supporting gold and creating uncertainty. Any escalation or de-escalation could significantly impact safe-haven flows.
