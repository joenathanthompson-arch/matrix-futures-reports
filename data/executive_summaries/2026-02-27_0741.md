HY OAS was sourced from FRED BAMLH0A0HYM2 at 2.94% (Feb 25, 2026). All other sources — VIX, DXY, MOVE, SOX, Copper, EIA, CME FedWatch, GDPNow, ECB/RBA/BoJ statements — were accessed directly from their primary URLs. No stale data was used.

## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** BULLISH — Gold and Silver strongly bullish on falling real yields, ETF inflows, and USD weakness; CL neutral due to massive +16.0M bbl inventory build offsetting geopolitical support.
- **Indices:** BULLISH — Falling real yields and a steepening yield curve provide a fundamental tailwind, though rising VIX (+7.68%) and falling SOX (-3.19%) introduce near-term caution, particularly for NQ.
- **FX:** BULLISH — EUR supported by accelerating Eurozone PMI and narrowing rate differential; JPY strongly bullish on BoJ hawkish pivot and risk-off safe-haven demand; AUD neutral as RBA hike is offset by China slowdown and risk-off environment.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a strong bullish bias (+6, STRONG_BULLISH), driven by the most powerful combination of macro factors currently present. The 10Y TIPS real yield fell to 1.698% (-2.8bps intraday, weight 2x), directly reducing the opportunity cost of holding gold. The DXY is weak at 97.70 (-0.09%), and VIX has crossed above 20 into risk-off territory (+7.68%), both adding safe-haven demand. Gold ETF inflows remain robust — GLD recorded $276M in inflows last week, and global gold ETF AUM hit all-time highs in January 2026. The only offsetting factor is the oil supply shock reading (easing/oversupply = -1), which is a minor drag. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or WITH_TREND long (8/10 confidence).

**SI (Silver):** Silver shows a strong bullish bias (+6, STRONG_BULLISH), benefiting from the same precious metals tailwinds as gold — falling real yields, weak USD, and risk-off VIX — with the added industrial confirmation of rising copper (+1.87% today). Silver's hybrid precious/industrial nature means it tends to outperform gold in a reflation environment; the current setup of falling real yields plus rising copper is a rare and powerful alignment. Confidence is slightly lower than gold (7/10) due to silver's higher volatility and sensitivity to growth narrative shifts. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or WITH_TREND long (7/10 confidence).

**CL (Crude):** Crude oil shows a neutral bias (-1, NEUTRAL), the result of sharply conflicting forces. The EIA weekly report (week ending Feb 20) showed a massive +16.0 million barrel crude inventory build — one of the largest single-week builds in recent memory — which is a strongly bearish supply signal (weight 2x for supply shock, weight 1x for inventories = -3 combined). This is partially offset by rising geopolitical risk (+1) from Trump's 10% global tariff regime and ongoing trade war uncertainty, plus a weak DXY (+1). GDPNow at 3.1% provides a stable demand backdrop (neutral). The inventory build is the dominant factor and prevents a bullish reading. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTREMES or NO_TRADE pending next EIA report (7/10 confidence).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 shows a strong bullish bias (+5, STRONG_BULLISH) on a macro fundamental basis, primarily driven by falling real yields (weight 2x = +4), which reduce the discount rate for equities. The weak DXY and risk-off VIX (>20) both add to the score, while credit spreads remain flat at 2.94% — not widening, which would signal stress. The key caveat is that VIX is rising sharply (+7.68%) and is now above 20, suggesting near-term price pressure even if the macro fundamental backdrop is supportive. This creates a divergence between the fundamental score and the near-term price action. Confidence is 6/10 due to this conflict. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on dips with caution; watch VIX for stabilization signal (6/10 confidence).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** Nasdaq shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH), one step below the other indices, due to specific headwinds from the SOX semiconductor index (-3.19% today = -1) and rising MOVE index (+2.40% = -1). The SOX decline reflects sector-specific pressure — NVDA is down 5.46%, ASML down 4.11% — likely tied to tariff concerns and AI spending uncertainty. Rising rate volatility (MOVE) adds uncertainty to the duration-sensitive tech sector. Falling real yields (weight 2x = +4) remain the primary bullish driver, but the semi weakness is a meaningful near-term headwind. Recommended approach: HALF_SIZE IB_BREAKOUT; monitor SOX for stabilization before full position (6/10 confidence).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow shows a strong bullish bias (+5, STRONG_BULLISH), benefiting from falling real yields, weak USD, risk-off VIX, and a steepening yield curve (+0.60 on 2s10s). The steepening curve is a positive signal for Dow components, particularly financials and industrials, as it improves net interest margins and signals growth expectations. Credit spreads are flat at 2.94%, indicating no systemic stress. The Dow's lower beta to tech/semis makes it a cleaner vehicle in the current environment where NQ faces SOX headwinds. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or WITH_TREND long (6/10 confidence).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Russell 2000 shows a strong bullish bias (+5, STRONG_BULLISH) on the fundamental scorecard, but this reading carries the lowest confidence of all equity indices (5/10). Small caps are most sensitive to credit conditions and domestic growth, and while credit spreads are currently flat (2.94%), the rising VIX and risk-off environment historically precede spread widening. The steepening yield curve is a positive signal for small-cap bank lending, and falling real yields reduce borrowing costs. However, the combination of VIX >20, rising MOVE, and trade war uncertainty creates meaningful downside risk for the most leveraged domestic companies. Recommended approach: WAIT for VIX stabilization below 20 before entering; monitor HY spreads closely (5/10 confidence).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro shows a strong bullish bias (+5, STRONG_BULLISH) against the USD. The primary driver is the narrowing rate differential — with the DXY falling and EUR gaining, the 175bps USD rate advantage is being partially offset by EUR's improving growth outlook. The Eurozone flash PMI rose to 51.9 in February (vs 51.3 in January), with manufacturing PMI hitting a 44-month high at 50.8. Both the Fed and ECB held rates at their most recent meetings, but the ECB's hold comes from a position of improving growth, while the Fed holds amid tariff uncertainty. Risk-off VIX adds a minor safe-haven demand for USD, but the DXY weakness and Eurozone growth acceleration dominate. Recommended approach: WITH_TREND long EUR/USD; support at 1.1750 per ING (7/10 confidence).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar shows a neutral bias (0, NEUTRAL), reflecting a genuine tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces. The RBA's surprise unanimous +25bps hike to 3.85% on February 3 gave AUD a positive carry advantage and is bullish. Copper rising (+1.87%) and a weak DXY are also supportive. However, China's official manufacturing PMI fell to 49.3 (below the 50 expansion threshold), which is a significant bearish signal for the commodity-linked, China-dependent AUD (weight 2x = -2). The risk-off VIX environment (weight 2x = -2) further weighs on this high-beta risk currency. The bullish and bearish factors are nearly perfectly balanced. Recommended approach: NO_TRADE or FADE_EXTREMES; wait for China PMI improvement or risk-on VIX signal (6/10 confidence).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen shows a strong bullish bias (+6, STRONG_BULLISH), the joint highest score alongside GC and SI. The BoJ's most hawkish board member Takata publicly called for more rate hikes on February 26, reinforcing the hawkish pivot narrative (weight 2x = +2). The JPY-USD rate differential is widening as the BoJ hikes while the Fed holds (weight 2x = +2). Additionally, the risk-off VIX environment (>20) drives safe-haven demand into JPY (+1), and the weak DXY adds a further tailwind (+1). Remember that 6J is quoted inversely — bullish 6J means USD/JPY is falling. Recommended approach: WITH_TREND long 6J (short USD/JPY); high conviction setup (8/10 confidence).

## Key Macro Themes

- **Safe-haven bid dominates:** VIX above 20 with rising rate volatility (MOVE +2.40%) is creating a broad flight-to-quality environment that simultaneously benefits gold, silver, and JPY while creating headwinds for risk assets like small caps and high-beta FX.
- **Real yield decline is the primary macro tailwind:** The 10Y TIPS yield at 1.698% and falling is the single most powerful factor in this report, providing the fundamental justification for bullish readings across precious metals, equities (via lower discount rates), and EUR/USD (via USD weakness).
- **Trade war tariff uncertainty is a cross-asset wildcard:** Trump's 10% global tariff (in effect as of February 24) is elevating geopolitical risk across all instruments, supporting gold and JPY as hedges while creating uncertainty for growth-sensitive assets and commodity demand.

## Watch List

- **FOMC Meeting (March 18-19):** Current FedWatch shows 96% probability of hold; any shift in language toward cuts would be strongly bullish for gold, NQ, and RTY.
- **EIA Weekly Petroleum Report (Wednesday, March 4):** The +16.0M bbl build is the dominant CL bearish signal; a reversal to a draw would shift CL bias to bullish.
- **China PMI (March 1 official release):** Official PMI at 49.3 is the primary drag on 6A and a headwind for commodities; improvement above 50 would shift both readings.
- **BoJ Policy Meeting (March 19):** Any formal rate hike announcement would be a strong catalyst for 6J strength; watch for Takata and Ueda commentary.
- **US PCE Inflation (February 28):** Core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure; a hot reading would shift Fed stance toward hawkish hold and reduce bullish scores across equities and gold.
