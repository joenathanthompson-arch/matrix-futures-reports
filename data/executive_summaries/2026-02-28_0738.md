## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** BULLISH - Gold and silver supported by falling real yields and strong ETF inflows; crude oil bearish on record 16M barrel inventory build
- **Indices:** BULLISH - Falling real yields and tight credit spreads support all four index futures; MOVE spike and rising VIX introduce near-term caution for NQ
- **FX:** BULLISH - AUD and JPY both bullish on hawkish central bank divergence from Fed; EUR neutral on matched ECB/Fed hold

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a bullish bias (+3, BULLISH, confidence 8/10), primarily driven by sharply falling real yields (DFII10 at 1.74%, down approximately 26bps from recent highs near 2.0%) and robust gold ETF inflows of $18 billion-plus year-to-date through February 20 per the World Gold Council. The Fed's neutral hold stance and flat USD provide no headwind. Conflicting signals include an accelerating GDPNow estimate of 3.0% for Q1 2026 (which typically reduces gold's safe-haven appeal) and a massive crude oil inventory build (which signals demand softness). Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (8/10) — real yield trend is dominant driver and clearly directional.

**SI (Silver):** Silver shows a bullish bias (+3, BULLISH, confidence 7/10), benefiting from the same falling real yield environment as gold while receiving additional support from copper's strong uptrend ($6.089/lb, +3.20% on the week, +15.49% over three months). Silver's hybrid precious/industrial nature means the copper strength is a meaningful positive signal. The accelerating GDPNow reading is a mild headwind for the industrial component. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10) — gold/copper alignment is a relatively rare bullish signal for silver.

**CL (Crude):** WTI crude shows a bearish bias (-4, BEARISH, confidence 8/10), driven by a historically large inventory build of 16.0 million barrels for the week ending February 20 (reported by EIA on February 25) — one of the largest single-week builds on record. This supply shock, combined with an accelerating GDPNow that does not reflect slowing demand, creates a double-negative for crude. Geopolitical risk (tariffs, Middle East, Ukraine) provides partial support and is the primary upside risk. Recommended approach: IB_FADE_EXTENSIONS (8/10) — inventory data is fresh and unambiguous; geopolitical risk is the key wildcard to monitor.

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 shows a bullish bias (+3, BULLISH, confidence 6/10), supported by falling real yields (the dominant driver with 2x weight) and tight HY credit spreads at 2.98% near multi-year lows. The VIX at 19.86 is in the balanced range, though its +6.61% intraday spike introduces near-term caution. The MOVE index spiking +14.79% on the day signals elevated rate volatility that could weigh on risk assets intraday. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10) — structural macro is bullish but intraday volatility elevated; size appropriately.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 shows a slight bullish bias (+1, SLIGHT_BULLISH, confidence 6/10). While falling real yields are the strongest positive driver (NQ is the most rate-sensitive index), this is offset by a falling SOX semiconductor index (-1.21% on the day, -2.28% on the month) and a sharply rising MOVE index (+14.79%). The semiconductor sector's underperformance is a meaningful headwind for mega-cap tech. Recommended approach: WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION (6/10) — conflicting signals between rate tailwind and semis/rate-vol headwinds; consider half-size on first entry.

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones shows a slight bullish bias (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH, confidence 6/10), supported by falling real yields, tight credit spreads, and a steepening yield curve (T10Y2Y at 0.59%). The growth narrative is the primary headwind with 2x weight, as an accelerating GDPNow of 3.0% reduces the case for Fed easing that would most benefit cyclical Dow components. The steepening curve is a positive signal for financials within the Dow. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10) — lower beta than NQ, cleaner vehicle when rate volatility is elevated.

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 shows a bullish bias (+3, BULLISH, confidence 6/10). The dominant positive drivers are falling real yields and tight credit spreads (both with 2x weight for RTY given small-cap sensitivity to credit conditions). The steepening yield curve also supports small-cap financials. The primary headwind is the accelerating growth narrative (2x weight), as a 3.0% GDPNow reduces the probability of Fed cuts that would most benefit small-cap borrowers. Note that RTY closed down -1.68% on February 27, suggesting near-term selling pressure despite the macro tailwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10) — macro supports but intraday price action is weak; confirm direction at open.

**M6E (Euro FX):** The Euro shows a neutral bias (0, NEUTRAL, confidence 6/10). Both the ECB (neutral hold on February 5, fifth consecutive hold) and the Fed (neutral hold) are in a matched holding pattern, leaving the rate differential between EUR and USD essentially unchanged. The DXY is flat on the week, and the VIX is in the balanced range. EUR/USD analysis from multiple sources confirms a "neutral bias" with the pair showing only 0.36% movement over four sessions. Recommended approach: AVOID or RANGE_TRADE (6/10) — no directional catalyst; wait for ECB/Fed divergence to re-emerge.

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian dollar shows a bullish bias (+3, BULLISH, confidence 7/10). The primary driver is the RBA's hawkish rate hike to 3.85% on February 3 — the first hike in two years — which has widened the AUD-USD rate differential and attracted carry interest. Copper's strong uptrend (+15.49% over three months) provides additional commodity-currency support. China's mixed PMI data (NBS 49.3 contraction, Caixin 50.3 slight expansion) and neutral risk sentiment are not headwinds at current levels. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10) — RBA divergence from Fed is a clear, fresh catalyst.

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese yen shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH, confidence 7/10). Note that 6J is inverted — bullish 6J means JPY strengthening and USD/JPY falling. The primary drivers are the BoJ's hawkish stance (door open for near-term rate hikes per Governor Ueda on February 26) and the narrowing JPY-USD rate differential as BoJ normalizes while the Fed holds. Both BoJ stance and rate differential carry 2x weight in the scoring configuration. The current USD/JPY level of approximately 155-156 provides significant room for JPY appreciation toward the 140-145 range targeted by analysts by end-2026. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10) — BoJ policy divergence is the clearest macro trade in the FX space currently.

## Key Macro Themes

**Theme 1 — Falling Real Yields Dominate:** The DFII10 10-year TIPS yield has fallen approximately 26 basis points from recent highs to 1.74%, creating a broad tailwind for gold, silver, equities, and rate-sensitive currencies. This is the single most impactful macro factor across the scorecard today.

**Theme 2 — Oil Supply Glut vs. Geopolitical Risk:** The 16-million-barrel crude inventory build (week ending February 20) is one of the largest on record and creates a clear bearish structural backdrop for CL. However, elevated and rising geopolitical risk (tariff escalation, Middle East tensions, Ukraine) remains the key upside wildcard. The net result is a BEARISH score of -4 for CL.

**Theme 3 — Central Bank Divergence Favors Non-USD:** The RBA's rate hike to 3.85% and the BoJ's continued normalization path stand in contrast to the Fed's neutral hold, creating favorable rate differentials for AUD and JPY. This divergence is the dominant driver for the FX asset class bias of BULLISH.

## Watch List

The following upcoming events could materially shift the bias scores:

- **PCE Inflation (Feb 28, 2026):** Core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. A hot reading could shift Fed stance from Neutral to Hawkish Hold, negatively impacting GC, ES, NQ, and RTY.
- **ISM Manufacturing PMI (Mar 3, 2026):** A sub-50 reading would shift the growth narrative from Accelerating to Slowing, which would be bullish for gold and bonds but mixed for equities.
- **EIA Weekly Petroleum Report (Mar 4, 2026):** Following the record 16M barrel build, the next inventory reading is critical for CL direction. A draw would partially reverse the bearish signal.
- **RBA Meeting Minutes (Mar 4, 2026):** Any forward guidance on additional hikes would reinforce the 6A bullish thesis.
- **BoJ Rate Decision (Mar 19, 2026):** An actual rate hike would be a strong confirmation signal for 6J bulls and would likely push USD/JPY lower.
- **FOMC Meeting (Mar 18-19, 2026):** Any shift in Fed language toward dovish or hawkish would be the highest-impact event for all 10 instruments.
