# Executive Summary - January 28, 2026 02:38 EST

## Data Quality Notes

All macro data is fresh (<24 hours old). Used CNBC as fallback for real yields as FRED data was 12 hours old. Gold ETF flow data and latest EIA inventory data were unavailable, so neutral scores were assigned for these factors.

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities:** BULLISH - Gold and silver showing strong bullish bias driven by falling real yields and weak USD. Crude oil remains neutral due to conflicting signals and missing inventory data.

**Indices:** STRONG_BULLISH - All four equity indices showing bullish to strong bullish bias. Falling real yields, dovish Fed stance, and narrowing credit spreads are primary drivers. Tech indices (NQ, ES) leading with highest conviction.

**FX:** BULLISH - Japanese yen showing strong bullish bias on BoJ tightening expectations and rate differential widening. Australian dollar slight bullish on commodity strength. Euro neutral due to limited ECB policy divergence.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold exhibits a strong bullish bias with a score of +5, driven primarily by falling real yields (down to 1.88% from 1.897%) which carry double weight in the gold scoring model. The dovish Fed stance (97.2% probability of hold) and weak USD (down 2.29% over 5 days) provide additional support. Strong growth (GDPNow at 5.4%) creates a minor headwind as it reduces safe-haven demand, but the overwhelming bullish factors dominate. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10 confidence).

**SI (Silver):** Silver shows a bullish bias with a score of +4, benefiting from the same macro tailwinds as gold including falling real yields, weak USD, and dovish Fed policy. The rising copper price (+3.31% over one week) provides additional support as it signals industrial demand strength. Silver's dual nature as both precious and industrial metal makes it sensitive to growth concerns, with accelerating GDP creating a minor offset. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10 confidence).

**CL (Crude):** Crude oil remains neutral with a score of 0, reflecting conflicting signals and data limitations. Rising geopolitical risk (Trump tariff threats, international tensions) and weak USD provide bullish support, but strong growth expectations paradoxically create a bearish offset in the oil model due to potential demand destruction concerns. Missing EIA inventory data reduces confidence significantly. Recommended approach: WAIT_AND_SEE (5/10 confidence).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 shows a strong bullish bias with a score of +6, the highest conviction among broad equity indices. Falling real yields (double-weighted in the model) at 1.88% provide the primary bullish driver, as lower real rates increase the present value of future earnings. Narrowing credit spreads (2.69%, down from ~3.0% in late 2025) signal improving financial conditions. The dovish Fed stance and weak USD add further support. Strong growth creates a minor headwind but is overwhelmed by positive factors. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (8/10 confidence).

**NQ (Nasdaq):** Nasdaq leads all instruments with the highest bullish score of +7, reflecting tech's sensitivity to falling real yields and rate volatility. The double-weighted real yields factor at +4 provides the strongest tailwind. Rising semiconductors (SOX +2.40% today, +12.28% over one month) and falling MOVE index (bond volatility down 5.78% over 5 days) create an ideal environment for growth stocks. The dovish Fed and weak USD provide additional support. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (8/10 confidence).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow shows a bullish bias with a score of +4, reflecting its value-oriented composition and sensitivity to growth factors. The double-weighted growth factor creates a -2 headwind as the Dow's industrial and financial components are more cyclical. However, falling real yields, narrowing credit spreads, steepening yield curve (2s10s at 0.71%), and dovish Fed provide sufficient bullish offset. The Dow offers a more defensive equity exposure than Nasdaq. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10 confidence).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Small caps show a strong bullish bias with a score of +5, driven by their high sensitivity to credit conditions and domestic growth. The double-weighted credit spreads factor provides +2 as spreads narrow to 2.69%, signaling improved access to capital for smaller companies. The double-weighted growth factor creates a -2 offset, but falling real yields, steepening curve, and dovish Fed more than compensate. Small caps are well-positioned if credit conditions continue to improve. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10 confidence).

**M6E (Euro):** The euro remains neutral with a score of 0, reflecting limited policy divergence between the Fed and ECB. While the dovish Fed stance and weak USD provide bullish support for EUR/USD, the lack of clear ECB hawkishness and the double-weighted rate differential factor (scored at -1 for narrowing) create offsetting headwinds. Eurozone growth remains stable but uninspiring. Confidence is reduced due to limited recent ECB communication. Recommended approach: WAIT_AND_SEE (5/10 confidence).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian dollar shows a slight bullish bias with a score of +2, supported by rising copper prices (+3.31% over one week) and weak USD. However, the double-weighted risk sentiment factor remains neutral (VIX at 16.35 in balanced range), limiting upside. The double-weighted China growth factor also scores neutral due to lack of recent PMI data. The AUD is a high-beta risk currency that would benefit from clearer risk-on signals or China stimulus. Recommended approach: IB_REVERSION (6/10 confidence).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese yen shows a strong bullish bias with a score of +6, the highest among FX instruments. The double-weighted BoJ stance factor provides +2 as Japan continues its policy normalization path, while the double-weighted rate differential factor adds another +2 as the gap between Japanese and US rates narrows with dovish Fed expectations. The weak USD provides additional support. Note that 6J quotes are inverted, so bullish 6J means bullish JPY and bearish USD/JPY. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10 confidence).

## Key Macro Themes

The dominant macro narrative is the powerful combination of falling real yields and dovish Fed expectations creating a strong tailwind for risk assets and precious metals. Real yields have declined to 1.88%, down from 1.897% just yesterday, as inflation expectations remain anchored while nominal yields compress on Fed dovishness. This creates an ideal environment for duration-sensitive assets like tech stocks and gold.

The weak USD (DXY down 2.29% over 5 days to 96.08) is providing broad-based support across commodities, equities, and foreign currencies. The dollar weakness reflects both dovish Fed expectations and growing concerns about US fiscal policy and geopolitical tensions, particularly around Trump's tariff threats and Greenland disputes.

Credit conditions continue to improve with high-yield spreads narrowing to 2.69%, the tightest levels since mid-2025. This signals growing confidence in corporate credit quality and improved access to capital, particularly beneficial for small-cap stocks and cyclical sectors. The combination of narrowing credit spreads and steepening yield curve (2s10s at 0.71%) suggests markets are pricing in a soft-landing scenario.

## Watch List

**FOMC Meeting (January 28, 2026):** The next FOMC meeting is today, with markets pricing 97.2% probability of a hold at 3.50-3.75%. Any hawkish surprise in the statement or dot plot could reverse the current bullish bias across risk assets. Watch for language around inflation progress and labor market conditions.

**EIA Weekly Petroleum Report (January 28, 2026):** The next EIA inventory report is due today and will be critical for refining the crude oil bias. Current score is neutral due to missing data. A large inventory draw would shift bias bullish, while a build would shift bearish.

**ECB Meeting (February 6, 2026):** The next ECB policy decision will be important for EUR/USD direction. Any hawkish shift or indication of rate hikes would strengthen the euro bias from current neutral levels.

**China PMI Data (January 31, 2026):** Manufacturing and services PMI data from China will be critical for assessing the Australian dollar outlook, as the double-weighted China growth factor currently scores neutral due to lack of recent data.

**Q4 GDP Advance Estimate (January 29, 2026):** The BEA will release the advance Q4 GDP estimate, which can be compared against the GDPNow forecast of 5.4%. Any significant deviation could shift growth-sensitive instruments like YM and RTY.
