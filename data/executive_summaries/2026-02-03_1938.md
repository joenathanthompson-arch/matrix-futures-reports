# Executive Summary - February 3, 2026 19:38 EST

## Data Quality Notes

Real yields data from FRED (DFII10) was 1 day old, so CNBC real-time data was used as fallback. All other macro data is current and verified from primary sources.

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities:** MIXED - Silver and crude oil show bullish bias driven by weak USD and inventory draws, but gold remains neutral as rising real yields offset safe-haven demand.

**Indices:** MIXED - Divergent signals across equity indices with tech-heavy ES and NQ facing headwinds from rising real yields and falling semiconductors, while YM and RTY benefit from narrowing credit spreads and curve steepening.

**FX:** BULLISH - All three major currency pairs show bullish bias as weak USD (down 10% year-over-year) provides tailwind across euro, Australian dollar, and yen.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a neutral bias (-1), caught between conflicting forces. Rising real yields (up to 1.927% from 1.917%) create a significant headwind, offsetting support from weak USD and strong ETF inflows ($4.39 billion in January, eighth consecutive month). The lack of a clear risk-off environment (VIX at 18, balanced range) limits safe-haven demand. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (6/10). Wait for clearer directional catalyst before establishing positions.

**SI (Silver):** Silver displays a slight bullish bias (+2), benefiting from the hybrid precious/industrial metal dynamic. Copper strength (+40% year-over-year) and weak USD provide support, though rising real yields temper enthusiasm. Silver typically follows gold but with higher beta, making it vulnerable to whipsaws in the current mixed environment. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Look for confirmation above key resistance levels.

**CL (Crude):** Crude oil shows a bullish bias (+3), supported by unexpected inventory draws (2.3 million barrel decrease versus expectations for a build), weak USD, and elevated geopolitical risk. However, stable growth outlook (GDPNow at 4.2%) limits upside as demand concerns remain contained. Recent price action suggests consolidation near four-month highs. Recommended approach: PULLBACK_BUY (6/10). Consider dips as buying opportunities given inventory dynamics.

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 exhibits a slight bearish bias (-2), pressured by rising real yields (major headwind for equity valuations) and increasing VIX (up 10% to 18.00). Narrowing credit spreads (HY OAS at 2.81%) provide some support, but the weight of higher discount rates dominates. Dovish Fed expectations offer limited relief given the magnitude of the real yield move. Recommended approach: FADE_STRENGTH (5/10). Reduce exposure on rallies until real yields stabilize.

**NQ (Nasdaq):** Nasdaq shows a slight bearish bias (-2), facing the double headwind of rising real yields (heavily weighted at 2x in scoring) and semiconductor weakness (SOX down 2% on the day, down 4.5% on the week). Tech valuations are particularly sensitive to real rate changes, and the recent pullback in chips signals potential earnings pressure. Falling MOVE index (rate volatility) provides minor offset. Recommended approach: WAIT_AND_SEE (5/10). Avoid new longs until SOX stabilizes and real yields peak.

**YM (Dow):** The Dow Jones shows a slight bullish bias (+2), demonstrating relative strength versus tech-heavy indices. Lower sensitivity to real yields (single weight versus double for NQ/ES), steepening yield curve (2s10s at 0.71%), and narrowing credit spreads favor the blue-chip index. Value orientation provides defensive characteristics in current environment. Recommended approach: RELATIVE_VALUE (6/10). Consider as equity exposure alternative to tech-heavy indices.

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Russell 2000 displays a bullish bias (+3), the strongest among equity indices. Small caps benefit significantly from narrowing credit spreads (double-weighted at 2x given reliance on bank lending and high-yield markets) and curve steepening. Domestically-focused companies gain from weak USD less than multinationals lose. Stable growth outlook (GDPNow 4.2%) supports domestic economic activity. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Small caps often lead at cycle turns; current setup favors tactical longs.

**M6E (Euro):** Euro shows a slight bullish bias (+2), primarily driven by USD weakness (DXY down 0.23% on day, down 10% year-over-year). Interest rate differentials remain stable with both Fed and ECB in holding patterns. Lack of eurozone-specific catalysts limits conviction, but technical setup favors continued USD weakness. Balanced risk sentiment (VIX at 18) provides neutral backdrop. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (6/10). Ride USD weakness but maintain tight stops given lack of fundamental catalyst.

**6A (Australian Dollar):** Australian dollar exhibits a bullish bias (+3), the strongest among FX pairs. Benefits from weak USD, rising copper prices (up 40% year-over-year, Australia's key export), and risk-on characteristics. China growth remains stable, supporting commodity demand and Australia's largest trading partner. RBA policy stance neutral but commodity tailwinds dominate. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). AUD strength likely to persist while commodity complex remains firm and USD weak.

**6J (Japanese Yen):** Yen shows a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by weak USD as primary driver. However, lack of clear risk-off environment (VIX balanced at 18) limits safe-haven flows. BoJ policy remains neutral with no recent hawkish pivot to narrow rate differentials. Note that 6J futures quote yen directly, so bullish 6J means bullish yen and bearish USD/JPY spot. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (6/10). Yen strength likely capped without risk-off catalyst or BoJ policy shift.

## Key Macro Themes

The dominant macro narrative centers on the divergence between weak USD (down 10% year-over-year, DXY at 97.38) and rising real yields (10-year TIPS at 1.927%, up from 1.917%). This creates a bifurcated market where FX and commodities benefit from currency weakness while rate-sensitive equities face valuation pressure. Credit markets remain constructive with HY spreads at 2.81% (narrowing trend), supporting risk assets and particularly benefiting small caps. The Fed maintains a dovish hold stance (89.6% probability of no change at next meeting) but market focus has shifted to real rate dynamics rather than nominal policy. Geopolitical risk remains elevated with VIX rising 10% to 18.00, though still in balanced range rather than risk-off territory.

## Watch List

**February 5, 2026:** FOMC meeting decision (89.6% probability of hold, 10.4% probability of cut). Any shift in forward guidance or dot plot could materially impact real yield trajectory and equity valuations.

**February 4, 2026:** FRED data releases for DFII10 (real yields), BAMLH0A0HYM2 (credit spreads), and T10Y2Y (yield curve). Confirmation of real yield direction critical for equity bias.

**Weekly EIA Report:** Next petroleum status report will update crude inventory data. Current draw of 2.3 million barrels supports oil prices, but reversal to builds would pressure CL.

**Semiconductor Earnings:** SOX weakness (down 4.5% week-to-date) ahead of key chip earnings could signal broader tech sector pressure. Watch for guidance revisions.

**China PMI Data:** Next release will update growth outlook for Australia's largest trading partner, directly impacting 6A bias and commodity demand outlook.
