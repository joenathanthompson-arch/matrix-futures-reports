## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** MIXED — Gold and Silver are bullish on falling real yields and USD weakness, but crude oil faces strong bearish pressure from a massive +16 million barrel inventory build.
- **Indices:** BULLISH — All four index instruments show bullish or better signals, led by NQ (STRONG_BULLISH) driven by falling real yields, rising SOX, and declining bond volatility.
- **FX:** BULLISH — Two of three FX instruments are bullish or better. The Yen (6J) is STRONG_BULLISH on BoJ hawkish pivot; the Aussie (6A) is BULLISH on RBA rate hike and AUD rate advantage; the Euro (M6E) is NEUTRAL as rate differential headwinds offset USD weakness.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH) driven by three converging tailwinds: falling 10-year real yields (DFII10 at 1.77%, down approximately 8 basis points over the past week), a significantly weakened US dollar (DXY near 97.77, well below its 52-week high of 107.66), and continued strong inflows into gold ETFs (over $18 billion year-to-date through February 20 per the World Gold Council). The accelerating US growth narrative (GDPNow at 3.1%) and easing oil supply conditions provide modest offsets, but the dominant macro setup remains constructive for gold. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (8/10 confidence). Signal decay consideration: this setup has multi-week durability given structural USD weakness and sustained ETF demand.

**SI (Silver):** Silver shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH) benefiting from the same precious metals tailwinds as gold — falling real yields, USD weakness, and positive ETF flow sentiment — with the additional support of rising copper prices (approximately $5.97/lb, up 1.81% over the past month). Silver's hybrid precious/industrial character means the accelerating growth environment (GDPNow 3.1%) is less of a headwind here than for pure safe-haven assets, as industrial demand expectations remain firm. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10 confidence). Note that silver can whipsaw on regime changes; position sizing should reflect its higher beta versus gold.

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil shows a bearish bias (-4, BEARISH) dominated by a massive and unexpected 16 million barrel inventory build for the week ending February 20, 2026, as reported by the EIA on February 25. This is the primary driver and receives double weighting in the scoring model. The accelerating US growth narrative (GDPNow 3.1%) provides only modest demand support, while the USD weakness provides a slight offset. Geopolitical risk is assessed as stable, offering no premium. The supply picture is clearly bearish and the EIA data is fresh. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (8/10 confidence). Traders should watch for any OPEC response or geopolitical escalation that could rapidly reverse this signal.

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH) supported by falling real yields (the most heavily weighted factor at 2x, contributing +4 to the score), tight high-yield credit spreads (HY OAS at 2.94%, historically compressed), and a weakening dollar. The VIX is rising modestly today (+3.9% to 18.63), which acts as a mild headwind, and the accelerating growth narrative creates a slight offset in the model. Overall, the financial conditions backdrop remains constructive for equities. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10 confidence). The next FOMC meeting on March 18-19 is a key risk event to monitor.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 shows a strong bullish bias (+6, STRONG_BULLISH), the highest score among the index instruments. Falling real yields are the dominant driver (contributing +4 at double weight), and this is reinforced by a rising Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX at 8,467, up from approximately 8,109 a week ago) and a declining MOVE index (62.43, down from 70+ two weeks ago), indicating reduced bond market volatility. The combination of lower real rates, stronger semis, and calmer rate markets creates an ideal environment for long-duration technology equities. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (8/10 confidence). NQ is highest beta; half-size on first entry is recommended per the playbook.

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones shows a slight bullish bias (+1, SLIGHT_BULLISH) with a more mixed picture than the other indices. Falling real yields and tight credit spreads are supportive, but the accelerating growth narrative (which receives double weighting for YM) acts as a headwind in the model, and the flattening 2s10s yield curve (0.60%, down from 0.74% a month ago) provides a mild additional offset. YM is the most value-oriented of the index instruments and is less sensitive to the rate environment than NQ. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10 confidence). YM is a cleaner vehicle when NQ is volatile; the slight bullish signal suggests range-bound to mildly bullish price action.

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 shows a slight bullish bias (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH) with credit conditions as the key swing factor. The HY OAS at 2.94% (historically tight) receives double weighting for RTY and contributes +2 to the score, reflecting the healthy credit environment for small-cap, high-leverage companies. Falling real yields add further support. The flattening yield curve (-1) and accelerating growth narrative (double-weighted, -2) create offsetting headwinds. The net result is a modest bullish signal. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10 confidence). RTY is most sensitive to credit conditions; any widening in HY spreads would rapidly shift this signal bearish.

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro shows a neutral bias (0, NEUTRAL) as competing forces roughly balance out. The primary headwind is the interest rate differential: the ECB deposit rate at 2.00% (held unchanged on February 5) versus the Fed funds rate at 3.50-3.75% represents a significant yield disadvantage for EUR, and this factor receives double weighting. Partially offsetting this is the weakening US dollar (DXY ~97.77) and improving Eurozone economic momentum (flash composite PMI at 51.9 in February, a 44-month high in manufacturing). Both the Fed and ECB are on hold, providing no near-term catalyst for a directional break. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (6/10 confidence). Watch for any ECB communication shift or US data surprises that could break the current equilibrium.

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH) supported by a convergence of positive factors. The Reserve Bank of Australia delivered a hawkish 25 basis point rate hike to 3.85% on February 3, 2026, making the AUD cash rate marginally higher than the US Fed funds rate (3.50-3.75%), creating a slight positive rate differential. This is reinforced by USD weakness (DXY ~97.77) and rising copper prices (approximately $5.97/lb, up 1.81% over the past month), which is a key commodity driver for the AUD. China's growth picture is mixed (official NBS PMI at 49.3 in January, private RatingDog PMI at 50.3), keeping the China growth factor neutral. Risk sentiment is balanced, limiting additional upside. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10 confidence).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen shows a strong bullish bias (+5, STRONG_BULLISH), the highest score among FX instruments. The primary driver is the Bank of Japan's increasingly hawkish stance: Governor Ueda flagged a March or April rate hike possibility on February 25 (Reuters), BoJ policymaker Takata called for continuing rate hikes on February 26, and overnight index swaps are pricing approximately 70% probability of an April hike. The BoJ stance receives double weighting and contributes +2, while the narrowing US-Japan rate differential (as BoJ hikes bring JPY yields higher) also receives double weighting and contributes +2. USD weakness adds a further +1. The current USD/JPY level near 156 remains elevated relative to fundamentals, suggesting room for continued JPY appreciation. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10 confidence). Note: 6J quotes are inverted — bullish 6J means bearish USD/JPY.

## Key Macro Themes

1. **Falling Real Yields as the Dominant Macro Driver:** The 10-year TIPS real yield (DFII10) has declined to 1.77%, down approximately 8 basis points from the prior week and well below the 2024 peak above 2.5%. This is the single most impactful factor in the current scoring cycle, driving bullish signals for gold, silver, NQ, and ES. The signal has multi-week durability as long as the Fed remains on hold and inflation expectations stay anchored.

2. **Crude Oil Oversupply Shock:** The EIA's February 25 report confirmed a 16 million barrel inventory build for the week ending February 20 — a historically large single-week increase. This is the dominant bearish catalyst for CL and reflects a significant supply-demand imbalance. Traders should monitor whether this is a one-time anomaly or the beginning of a sustained oversupply trend.

3. **Central Bank Divergence Driving FX:** The BoJ's hawkish pivot (March/April hike flagged, 70% April probability) and the RBA's February 3 rate hike to 3.85% contrast sharply with the Fed's neutral hold and the ECB's pause at 2.00%. This divergence creates clear directional biases: long 6J (bullish JPY), long 6A (bullish AUD), and neutral M6E (EUR caught between ECB pause and USD weakness).

## Watch List

The following upcoming events have the potential to materially shift bias scores:

**Imminent (within 48 hours):** FRED data releases scheduled for February 27, 2026, including the next Atlanta Fed GDPNow update, which could revise the current 3.1% Q1 2026 estimate and affect the growth narrative scoring for CL, YM, and RTY.

**Near-Term (1-4 weeks):** The next FOMC meeting on March 18-19, 2026 is the most significant scheduled risk event. Any shift in Fed language toward cuts would be strongly bullish for NQ, GC, and SI. The BoJ March meeting is also critical — a confirmed rate hike would further strengthen the 6J bullish signal. RBA's next meeting will determine whether the hiking cycle continues.

**Background:** Ongoing geopolitical developments (Middle East, Ukraine) remain a background risk that could rapidly shift GC, CL, and risk sentiment scores. OPEC+ production decisions could override the current inventory-driven bearish signal for CL.
