## Executive Summary

Today's end-of-day report reflects a significant late-session development: **January PPI came in materially hotter than expected** (Core PPI +0.8% MoM vs. +0.3% forecast; headline +0.5% vs. +0.3% forecast), driving a broad equity selloff into the close. The S&P 500 finished -0.43% at 6,878.88 and the Nasdaq Composite lost -0.92% to 22,668.21. This hot inflation print reduces near-term Fed cut expectations and has been incorporated into the equity scores, which are revised down by one point from the morning session.

The dominant macro theme remains the **precious metals bull run**: gold posted its best calendar month in over a decade in February, adding +$516.60/oz (+11%) to close near $5,246. The primary driver is the compression in real yields — DFII10 fell to 1.74% as of February 26, down from approximately 1.90% two weeks ago, as the bond market rallied strongly (10-year nominal yield broke below 4.00% intraday). Gold ETF inflows have reached $18B+ year-to-date, with GLD holdings at their highest level since April 2022. Silver futures surged +6.3% today to $93.30, benefiting from the gold momentum and copper's continued strength (+17.21% over three months).

The **crude oil picture is conflicted**: the bearish EIA inventory build of +16.0M barrels (week ending February 20) was the largest in recent history, but US-Iran geopolitical tensions escalated sharply today, with reports of potential US military action against Iran driving WTI crude +2.8% to close at $67.02. This geopolitical risk premium partially offsets the supply-side bearish signal, warranting a reduced bearish conviction of -1 rather than the -2 scored in the morning session.

The **FX landscape** is bifurcated: the Japanese Yen and Australian Dollar carry the strongest bullish signals, while the Euro faces structural headwinds from the USD rate differential. The BoJ's hawkish pivot continues to drive 6J higher (USD/JPY at 155.79), and the RBA's surprise hike to 3.85% on February 3 has propelled AUD/USD to three-year highs near 0.71.

## Instrument Analysis

**GC (Gold): Score +4 | BULLISH | Confidence 8/10**
Gold is the highest-conviction instrument in today's report. The 10-year TIPS real yield (DFII10) fell to 1.74% as of February 26 — down approximately 16 basis points from two weeks ago — providing the primary structural tailwind. Gold posted its best monthly gain in over a decade in February (+$516.60/oz, +11%), closing near $5,246. GLD ETF holdings are at their highest since April 2022, reflecting sustained institutional demand. The US-Iran geopolitical risk spike provides an additional safe-haven premium. The hot PPI print is a mild headwind but insufficient to override the real yield compression thesis. Signal decay note: this signal is expected to remain valid for 2-5 days; monitor US-Iran resolution and any Fed communication that could reverse real yield compression. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on pullbacks; SWING mode, 2-5 day hold (8/10).

**SI (Silver): Score +4 | BULLISH | Confidence 7/10**
Silver futures surged +6.3% today to $93.30 (March contract), driven by gold momentum and copper's continued strength. The gold-silver ratio is compressing, and silver's hybrid precious/industrial nature is being supported by both the safe-haven bid and the copper rally (+17.21% over three months). Real yield compression and gold ETF inflows provide the same structural tailwind as gold. Silver's higher beta means it can outperform gold in a precious metals rally but also whipsaw more violently. Signal decay note: valid 1-3 days; monitor gold direction and copper for continuation. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW; SWING mode, 1-3 day hold (7/10).

**CL (WTI Crude): Score -1 | SLIGHT_BEARISH | Confidence 7/10**
The crude oil signal is the most conflicted in today's report. The structural bearish case remains intact: the EIA reported a +16.0M barrel inventory build for the week ending February 20, the largest build in recent history, reflecting robust US production and tepid demand. However, US-Iran geopolitical tensions escalated sharply today, with reports of potential US military action against Iran driving WTI +2.8% to close at $67.02 — the highest since August 2025. This geopolitical risk premium reduces the net bearish score from -2 to -1. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; the OPEC+ meeting on March 4-5 is the next key catalyst; if US-Iran tensions escalate further or OPEC announces deeper cuts, the bias could flip to bullish. Recommended approach: FADE_RANGE; INTRADAY mode, session hold (7/10).

**ES (S&P 500): Score +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
The S&P 500 closed -0.43% at 6,878.88 on Friday, finishing February in the red. The hot PPI print (Core +0.8% MoM) is the dominant bearish catalyst for today's session, reducing near-term Fed cut expectations and weighing on risk appetite. The structural macro backdrop — falling real yields, stable growth (GDPNow 3.0%), and a neutral Fed — provides a modest bullish underpinning, but the hot inflation data and rising MOVE index (73.38, +14.79% today) create headwinds. Credit spreads have widened to 2.98% (HY OAS), adding further pressure on risk assets. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; the March 19 FOMC meeting is the next key catalyst. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (wait for initial balance to form before taking directional trades); INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100): Score +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
The Nasdaq Composite closed -0.92% on Friday, underperforming the S&P 500 as technology stocks bore the brunt of the AI-uncertainty and hot inflation selloff. The SOX semiconductor index fell -1.21% to 8,098.37 and is down -2.28% for the month, reflecting ongoing concerns about AI capex sustainability following the DeepSeek disruption in January. The MOVE index surge (+14.79% to 73.38) signals elevated rate volatility, which is a structural headwind for high-duration growth stocks. The structural tailwind from falling real yields (DFII10 1.74%) provides modest support. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; monitor SOX direction and any AI-related headlines. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**YM (Dow Jones): Score +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
The Dow Jones closed down more than 500 points on Friday, driven by the hot PPI print and broad risk-off positioning. However, the Dow's lower-beta composition and exposure to value/cyclical sectors provides relative resilience compared to the Nasdaq. The steepening yield curve (2s10s at 0.60%) is a mild positive for financials and cyclicals. The Chicago PMI surge to 57.7 (near 4-year high) is a positive growth signal for Dow-weighted industrials and consumer names. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000): Score 0 | NEUTRAL | Confidence 6/10**
The Russell 2000 is the most sensitive index to credit conditions, and the widening HY OAS (2.98%, up from recent lows near 2.70%) is a double-weighted headwind in the scoring model. The hot PPI print adds further pressure by reducing Fed cut expectations — small-cap companies are disproportionately reliant on floating-rate financing. The steepening yield curve (2s10s 0.60%) and stable growth provide offsetting support, resulting in a neutral score. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; monitor credit spreads and any regional bank headlines. Recommended approach: FADE_RANGE; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**M6E (Micro Euro FX): Score -3 | SLIGHT_BEARISH | Confidence 7/10**
The EUR/USD is trading near 1.1805, consolidating below the 20-day EMA which continues to act as a key resistance barrier. The primary bearish driver is the rate differential: the Fed holds at 3.50-3.75% while the ECB holds at 2.00%, creating a 150-175 basis point USD advantage. The hot US PPI print reinforces the "Fed holds longer" narrative, widening the rate differential further. Eurozone growth is accelerating (Composite PMI 51.9 in February, a 14-month high; manufacturing at a 44-month high), but this positive growth signal is insufficient to overcome the rate differential headwind. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; monitor ECB March 19 meeting for any hawkish surprise. Recommended approach: FADE_RANGE on rallies toward 1.183 resistance; INTRADAY mode, session hold (7/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar): Score +3 | BULLISH | Confidence 7/10**
The Australian Dollar is near three-year highs around 0.71, supported by a widening 60bp AU-US 2-year yield spread and broad USD structural weakness. The RBA's surprise hike to 3.85% on February 3 — the first hike in two years — has shifted the rate differential in AUD's favor: RBA 3.85% vs. Fed 3.50-3.75%, giving AUD a slight rate advantage. Copper's continued strength (+0.87% today, +17.21% over three months) provides additional commodity-currency support. Credit Agricole has raised its mid-2026 AUD/USD forecast to 0.73 from 0.67. China's mixed PMI data (official 49.3 contraction, Caixin 50.3 expansion) tempers conviction. Signal decay note: valid 1-2 days; monitor China PMI (March 2) and risk sentiment for continuation. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on dips toward 0.70 support; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (7/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen): Score +4 | BULLISH | Confidence 7/10**
The Japanese Yen carries a high-conviction bullish signal driven by the BoJ's accelerating hawkish pivot. The BoJ is currently at 0.75% with an April hike to 1.00% widely expected. USD/JPY is trading at 155.79, declining on the day as the JPY strengthens. The rate differential is narrowing as the BoJ tightens while the Fed holds — and the hot US PPI print, while bearish for equities, does not materially change the BoJ hiking trajectory. The BoJ holds only an 8% probability of a March hike, but the April meeting is the key catalyst. Safe-haven demand from US-Iran tensions and broad risk-off positioning provides an additional tailwind. Signal decay note: valid 2-5 days; the BoJ April meeting is the primary catalyst; monitor Tokyo CPI (February data showed some moderation) for any signals of a pause. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on USD/JPY pullbacks (selling USD/JPY); SWING mode, 2-5 day hold (7/10).

## Key Macro Themes

**1. Gold's Historic February and Real Yield Compression**
Gold posted its best calendar month in over a decade in February, adding +$516.60/oz (+11%) to close near $5,246. The primary driver is the compression in 10-year real yields (DFII10 at 1.74%, down from ~1.90% two weeks ago), as the bond market rallied strongly — the 10-year nominal yield broke below 4.00% intraday for the first time since November 2025. This real yield compression, combined with $18B+ in gold ETF inflows year-to-date and rising geopolitical risk, creates a powerful structural tailwind for precious metals.

**2. Stagflation Concern: Hot PPI Meets Strong Chicago PMI**
Today's economic data presents a challenging combination: Core PPI rose +0.8% MoM (more than double the +0.3% forecast), while the Chicago PMI surged to 57.7 (near a 4-year high, well above the 52.8 forecast). This combination — strong activity but persistent upstream inflation — raises stagflation concerns and reduces the probability of near-term Fed rate cuts. CME FedWatch now shows a 96-98% probability of a hold at the March 19 FOMC meeting. This is bearish for equities and supportive of the USD, but the bond market's rally (driven by safe-haven demand) is keeping real yields compressed, which continues to support gold.

**3. US-Iran Geopolitical Risk Spike**
Reports of potential US military action against Iran drove WTI crude oil +2.8% to close at $67.02 today, partially reversing the bearish signal from the +16.0M barrel EIA inventory build. This geopolitical risk premium also supports gold and the Japanese Yen as safe-haven assets. The situation is fluid and represents the primary upside risk to the crude oil bearish thesis.

**4. BoJ and RBA Divergence Driving FX**
The Bank of Japan's hawkish pivot (0.75% rate, April hike to 1.00% expected) and the RBA's surprise hike to 3.85% on February 3 are the primary drivers of the bullish signals for 6J and 6A respectively. Both central banks are tightening while the Fed holds, creating favorable rate differential dynamics for JPY and AUD. This divergence is expected to persist through at least the April BoJ meeting.
