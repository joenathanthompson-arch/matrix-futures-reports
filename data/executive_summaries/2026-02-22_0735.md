## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold) — Score: +1 (SLIGHT_BULLISH) | Confidence: 7/10**
Gold carries a slight bullish bias heading into the week. The primary support comes from a weak DXY (97.79, -1.01% on the month) and record gold ETF inflows — the World Gold Council reported January 2026 saw $19 billion in global gold ETF inflows, the strongest month on record, pushing holdings to an all-time high of 4,145 tonnes. The oil supply shock from US-Iran tensions adds a modest safe-haven bid. However, real yields are flat at 1.80% (not falling, which would be the strongest bullish catalyst), the Fed's hawkish pause is a headwind, and accelerating US growth (GDPNow 3.1%) reduces the urgency for defensive positioning. The net result is a slight lean bullish but not a high-conviction setup. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on a clean opening range, bias long, confidence 7/10. Wait for a confirmed break above Friday's high before committing.

**SI (Silver) — Score: +1 (SLIGHT_BULLISH) | Confidence: 7/10**
Silver mirrors gold's slight bullish tilt with an identical score of +1. The key alignment is copper rising strongly (+26.51% year-over-year, +1.75% on Friday) which supports silver's industrial demand component, while gold ETF inflows provide precious metals sector momentum. The same headwinds apply: flat real yields, hawkish Fed, and strong growth reducing safe-haven urgency. Silver's hybrid nature (precious + industrial) means it benefits from both the risk-on environment (copper rising, equities near highs) and the safe-haven bid from geopolitical tensions. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT, bias long, confidence 7/10. Silver tends to be more volatile than gold — size accordingly.

**CL (WTI Crude) — Score: +3 (BULLISH) | Confidence: 8/10**
Crude oil is the highest-conviction long in the commodity space this week. The bullish case rests on two reinforcing pillars: (1) US-Iran tensions have escalated significantly, with CNN reporting on February 20 that "oil prices jump as tensions ramp up between Iran and the US" and the Guardian noting fears of US military strikes on Iran — this is a genuine supply disruption risk, not just noise; and (2) the EIA weekly report for the week ending February 13 showed a massive 9.0 million barrel crude inventory draw, pushing stocks to 419.8 million barrels, approximately 5% below the five-year average. WTI has already rallied to near six-month highs (~$66-67). The only meaningful headwind is accelerating US growth (GDPNow 3.1%), which the model scores as slightly negative for CL, but in practice strong growth supports demand. The DXY weakness also provides a commodity tailwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or TREND_FOLLOW, bias long, confidence 8/10. Key risk: de-escalation of US-Iran tensions would trigger a sharp reversal.

**ES (S&P 500) — Score: +1 (SLIGHT_BULLISH) | Confidence: 7/10**
The S&P 500 carries a slight bullish bias with multiple offsetting forces. On the positive side: DXY weakness (+1), credit spreads near historic lows at 2.88% HY OAS (+1), and VIX falling sharply (-5.64% on Friday, +1). Against this: the Fed's hawkish pause (-1), flat real yields (0), and accelerating growth which reduces rate cut expectations (-1). The net result is a modest +1 lean. The macro backdrop is one of "good news is good news" — strong growth, tight credit, falling volatility — but the hawkish Fed limits the upside. ES closed at approximately 6,909 on Friday. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT, bias long, confidence 7/10. Geopolitical risk from US-Iran could introduce gap risk on Sunday open.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100) — Score: +1 (SLIGHT_BULLISH) | Confidence: 7/10**
Nasdaq 100 scores identically to ES at +1. The key differentiators for NQ are: SOX (Philadelphia Semiconductor Index) rising strongly at 8,260 (+13.33% YTD, near all-time high of 8,400 set Feb 12) which is a direct positive for tech, and the MOVE index falling sharply (-6.27% five-day) which reduces rate volatility and benefits long-duration tech valuations. Real yields being flat (not falling) is the key constraint — NQ's double-weight on real yields means any uptick in TIPS yields would be disproportionately negative. The hawkish Fed pause is the primary headwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT, bias long, confidence 7/10. NQ is highest-beta — half-size on first entry per system rules.

**YM (Dow Jones) — Score: 0 (NEUTRAL) | Confidence: 6/10**
The Dow Jones is the one equity index that scores neutral. The key difference from ES/NQ is the double-weight on growth narrative: accelerating growth (GDPNow 3.1%) scores -1 with 2x weight = -2, which offsets the positive contributions from DXY weakness (+1), credit spreads (+1), and curve steepening (+1). The Dow's value-heavy composition means it is more sensitive to the growth/inflation mix than pure tech indices. In a "growth accelerating but Fed hawkish" environment, YM faces cross-currents. Recommended approach: WAIT for clearer directional signal. If ES breaks out bullishly, YM can be used as a lower-beta vehicle. Confidence 6/10.

**RTY (Russell 2000) — Score: +1 (SLIGHT_BULLISH) | Confidence: 7/10**
Russell 2000 scores +1 slight bullish, driven primarily by the double-weighted credit spreads factor (+2) — HY OAS at 2.88% near historic lows is extremely supportive for small caps that rely heavily on high-yield financing. The curve steepening (+1) also benefits small cap banks. The headwinds are the same as other indices: hawkish Fed (-1) and accelerating growth double-weighted (-2). The net result is a slight lean bullish. RTY closed at approximately 2,669 on Friday. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT, bias long, confidence 7/10. Small caps are most sensitive to any credit spread widening — monitor HY OAS closely.

**M6E (Micro Euro FX) — Score: +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH) | Confidence: 7/10**
EUR/USD carries a slight bullish bias. The primary driver is the rate differential factor (double-weighted, +2): while the ECB holds at 2.00% and the Fed holds at 3.50-3.75%, forward markets are pricing in more Fed cuts than ECB moves in 2026, causing the differential to narrow in EUR's favor. The DXY weakness (+1) directly supports EUR/USD. The ECB's neutral stance (0) and eurozone growth improving (Composite PMI 51.9 in February, Q4 GDP +0.3%) provide a stable backdrop. The hawkish Fed (-1) is the main headwind. DXY at 97.79 is near multi-year lows, suggesting EUR/USD is in an uptrend. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT, bias long EUR/USD, confidence 7/10.

**6A (Australian Dollar) — Score: +3 (BULLISH) | Confidence: 7/10**
AUD/USD is a high-conviction bullish setup. The RBA surprised markets on February 3 by hiking 25bps to 3.85% — the first hike in two years — in a unanimous decision, signaling that Australian inflation remains elevated and the RBA is tightening while the Fed pauses. This creates a rate differential that now favors AUD (3.85% vs 3.625% Fed funds midpoint). Combined with DXY weakness (+1) and rising copper (+1, Australia's largest export), the AUD has fundamental support. The China growth factor (stable, 0) and risk sentiment (balanced, 0) are neutral rather than negative. The key risk is any deterioration in China's economy or a sharp risk-off event. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or TREND_FOLLOW, bias long AUD/USD, confidence 7/10.

**6J (Japanese Yen) — Score: +4 (BULLISH) | Confidence: 8/10**
Japanese Yen is the highest-conviction trade in the FX space. The BoJ is firmly in tightening mode: currently at 0.75%, a Reuters poll on February 19 shows consensus expects a hike to 1.00% by end-June 2026, with Oxford Economics projecting 1.50% by 2027. This BoJ tightening cycle (double-weighted, +2) combined with the narrowing JPY-USD rate differential (double-weighted, +2) creates a powerful structural tailwind for JPY. The DXY weakness (+1) amplifies this. The only headwind is the hawkish Fed pause (-1). The signal is BULLISH for 6J futures, meaning bullish JPY = bearish USD/JPY. Note: 6J quotes are inverted — a rising 6J price means USD/JPY is falling. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or TREND_FOLLOW, bias long 6J (short USD/JPY), confidence 8/10. This is the highest-conviction macro trade in the current environment.

## Key Macro Themes

1. **Diverging Central Bank Cycles:** The Fed's hawkish pause contrasts sharply with the BoJ's tightening cycle and the RBA's surprise hike, creating structural FX tailwinds for JPY and AUD against USD. This is the dominant macro theme for FX this week.

2. **US-Iran Geopolitical Risk Premium in Energy:** Escalating US-Iran tensions are injecting a genuine supply disruption premium into crude oil, amplified by a significant 9.0 million barrel inventory draw. CL is the highest-conviction directional trade in commodities.

3. **Risk-On with Caveats:** Falling VIX, tight credit spreads, and strong semiconductor performance signal a risk-on environment for equities, but the hawkish Fed pause and accelerating growth (reducing rate cut expectations) cap the upside. The result is a modest bullish lean rather than a strong breakout environment for indices.

## Watch List

The following events could materially shift bias during the week of February 22, 2026:

- **US-Iran Developments (Ongoing):** Any military action or diplomatic breakthrough would cause sharp moves in CL and safe-haven assets (GC, 6J). This is the highest-impact risk event.
- **Fed Speakers (Week of Feb 22):** Multiple FOMC members scheduled to speak. Any shift in tone from the hawkish pause narrative could move ES, NQ, and GC significantly.
- **PCE Inflation Data (Friday Feb 28):** The Fed's preferred inflation measure. A hot print reinforces the hawkish pause; a cool print could revive rate cut expectations and boost equities/gold.
- **BoJ Governor Ueda Speech:** Any commentary on the pace of rate hikes would amplify or dampen the 6J bullish thesis.
- **RBA Minutes (Tuesday Feb 24):** Detail on the reasoning behind the surprise February hike. Hawkish language would further support 6A.
- **US Consumer Confidence (Tuesday Feb 25):** Relevant for RTY and YM as a domestic growth indicator.
