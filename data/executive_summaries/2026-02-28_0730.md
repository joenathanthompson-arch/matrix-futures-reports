# Executive Summary - 2026-02-28 07:30 UTC (V3.0_STRATEGY)
## Data Quality Notes
FRED DFII10 (real yields) and BAMLH0A0HYM2 (HY OAS) are 2 business days old (last updated Feb 26, 2026), which is within the normal FRED lag window. Real-time fallbacks confirmed via TradingView (DXY, MOVE, SOX) and CME Group (copper, gold futures). VIX at 19.86 from CBOE close on Feb 27. USD/JPY is at 156.05, AUD/USD at 0.7115, and EUR/USD at 1.1804. EIA crude inventory data is from the Feb 25 release covering the week ending Feb 20 — the most recent available. **CRITICAL: US-Israel launched major combat operations against Iran on February 28, 2026 (today, approximately 02:00-04:00 UTC). This is a live geopolitical shock event. All confidence scores and recommended approaches have been adjusted to reflect the extreme uncertainty introduced by this event. The macro model scores reflect the pre-shock fundamental backdrop; the Iran war is captured directly in CL via the geopolitical risk factor and indirectly in GC and 6J via safe-haven demand.**

## Asset Class Overview
- **Commodities:** NEUTRAL — Gold (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH) and Silver (+3, BULLISH) are supported by falling real yields and safe-haven demand from the US-Iran war. Crude oil (-4, BEARISH) is structurally bearish due to the massive +16.0M barrel EIA inventory build, but the Iran war creates extreme upside risk via Strait of Hormuz disruption fears. The conflicting signals across the asset class produce a neutral aggregate bias.
- **Indices:** SLIGHT_BULLISH — The model indicates a slight bullish bias based on falling real yields, a steepening yield curve, and strong SOX/MOVE readings. However, this is a pre-shock reading. The US-Iran war is a major risk-off event that will dominate price action at the open. The model's bullishness should be heavily discounted for Monday's session; IB_BREAKOUT strategies are strongly preferred over pre-positioning.
- **FX:** NEUTRAL — The Japanese Yen (+4, BULLISH) is the strongest signal in the FX space, driven by BoJ tightening and safe-haven demand from the Iran conflict. The Euro (-4, BEARISH) is weighed down by a negative rate differential versus the USD. The Australian Dollar (0, NEUTRAL) is caught between a hawkish RBA and broad risk-off sentiment. The aggregate FX bias is neutral due to the offsetting signals.

## Symbol Analysis
**GC (Gold): Score +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
Gold shows a slight bullish bias driven by two key factors: falling real yields (10-Year TIPS at 1.74%, down ~6bps week-over-week) and consistent Gold ETF inflows, with the US and China leading a global surge in January 2026. The double-weighted real yields factor contributes +4 to the raw score, while the hawkish Fed stance (-1) is the primary headwind. The model score of +2 is the fundamental baseline, but the US-Iran war is a powerful safe-haven catalyst that is not fully captured by the pre-existing macro model. Gold futures (GC Apr '26) were already trading near $5,280 on Friday, up $103.50 on the session, and are expected to gap higher at the Sunday evening open. Signal decay note: the Iran war catalyst is expected to remain valid for 1-3 trading sessions; monitor real yield direction and Iran retaliation escalation for any catalyst shift. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on pullbacks toward key support; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (6/10).

**SI (Silver): Score +3 | BULLISH | Confidence 7/10**
Silver carries a bullish bias with stronger conviction than gold, supported by both precious metals and industrial metals tailwinds. Falling real yields, gold ETF inflows, and a rising copper price ($6.00/lb, +32% YoY) all contribute positively. Silver closed at approximately $92/oz on Friday and was already up 6%+ on the session, with analysts projecting a move toward $100 if the Iran conflict escalates. The industrial demand component (copper, SOX) adds a layer of support that gold does not have. The US-Iran war reinforces the bullish case for silver as a dual-purpose safe-haven and industrial metal. Signal decay note: the silver signal is expected to remain valid for 1-2 days; the key risk is a rapid de-escalation of the Iran conflict, which could remove the safe-haven premium. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW, half-size on first entry given Iran war volatility; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (7/10).

**CL (WTI Crude): Score -4 | BEARISH | Confidence 5/10**
Crude oil presents the most complex and uncertain setup of any instrument today. The model's BEARISH score of -4 is driven by the EIA's reported +16.0 million barrel crude inventory build for the week ending February 20 — the largest single-week build in recent months, pushing total commercial crude stocks to 435.8 million barrels. The double-weighted oil supply factor (-2) and inventory factor (-1) dominate the score. However, the US-Iran war is an extreme bullish catalyst that directly threatens the Strait of Hormuz, through which approximately 31% of global seaborne crude flows. WTI closed at $67.29 on Friday (+3.19%), and analysts are calling for a spike to $80/barrel if the conflict continues. The geopolitical risk factor contributes +1 to the raw score, but this single-weighted factor is insufficient to overcome the structural bearishness of the inventory data. The confidence score is low (5/10) due to the extreme conflict between hard supply data and geopolitical risk. Signal decay note: the Iran war catalyst could reverse this signal entirely within a single session if Strait of Hormuz disruption is confirmed. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT — wait for the Initial Balance to form in the first hour of trading, then trade the breakout direction; do NOT pre-position based on the model score given the conflicting forces; INTRADAY mode, session hold (5/10).

**ES (S&P 500): Score +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 4/10**
The S&P 500's slight bullish score of +1 reflects the underlying macro environment: falling real yields (double-weighted, +4 contribution) are partially offset by a hawkish Fed (-1), accelerating growth narrative (-1), and a rising VIX direction (-1). The S&P 500 closed at 6,878.88 on Friday (-0.43%), already pricing in some pre-war risk. The US-Iran war is a major risk-off event that will dominate Monday's open, and the model's slight bullishness should be heavily discounted. Analysts expect global equities to open 1-2% lower. The confidence score is low (4/10) to reflect this overriding geopolitical shock. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT — wait for the Initial Balance to form and trade the breakout; INTRADAY mode, session hold (4/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100): Score +4 | BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
The Nasdaq 100 carries the strongest bullish score among the equity indices, driven by falling real yields (double-weighted, +4 contribution), a falling MOVE index (+1), and a rising SOX semiconductor index (+1). These are powerful structural tailwinds for long-duration growth assets. However, the Iran war introduces significant near-term uncertainty. The Nasdaq closed at approximately 24,960 on Friday (-0.30%), and futures are expected to open lower on Sunday evening. The bullish score reflects the underlying fundamental backdrop, which remains intact; the Iran war is a temporary but severe headwind. Signal decay note: the NQ bullish signal is expected to reassert itself once the initial Iran war shock is absorbed, likely within 2-3 trading sessions. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on any dip toward key support levels; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (6/10).

**YM (Dow Jones): Score 0 | NEUTRAL | Confidence 4/10**
The Dow Jones shows a neutral bias, caught between bullish factors (falling real yields, steepening yield curve) and bearish factors (accelerating growth narrative, hawkish Fed). The Dow closed at 48,977.92 on Friday (-1.05%), already underperforming the broader market. The Iran war adds a significant layer of uncertainty. The neutral score accurately reflects the mixed fundamental backdrop, and the low confidence (4/10) reflects the overriding geopolitical shock. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE between key support and resistance levels; INTRADAY mode, session hold (4/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000): Score 0 | NEUTRAL | Confidence 4/10**
The Russell 2000 shows a neutral bias, with falling real yields (+1) and a steepening yield curve (+1) offset by an accelerating growth narrative (-2). Small-cap stocks are particularly vulnerable to risk-off shocks, and the Iran war is a major headwind. The RTY closed at approximately 2,632 on Friday (-1.68%), already showing relative weakness. The neutral score and low confidence (4/10) reflect the conflicting signals. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE or AVOID; INTRADAY mode, session hold (4/10).

**M6E (Micro Euro FX): Score -4 | BEARISH | Confidence 7/10**
The Euro carries a clear bearish bias driven by the negative interest rate differential between the Eurozone and the United States. The ECB held its deposit rate at 2.00% on February 5, while the Fed is holding at 3.50-3.75% — a 150-175 bps advantage for the USD. The double-weighted rate differential factor contributes -2 to the raw score, and the hawkish Fed stance adds another -1. The US-Iran war reinforces the bearish case for the Euro, as the US Dollar is the primary safe-haven currency and is expected to strengthen on geopolitical risk flows. EUR/USD is trading at approximately 1.1804, and a move toward 1.16-1.17 is plausible if the Iran conflict escalates. Signal decay note: the M6E bearish signal is expected to remain valid for 1-2 days; the key risk is a rapid USD reversal if the Iran conflict de-escalates. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on any rally toward 1.185 resistance; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (7/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar): Score 0 | NEUTRAL | Confidence 4/10**
The Australian Dollar is caught in a tug-of-war between a hawkish RBA and a risk-off global environment. The RBA's surprise 25 basis point rate hike on February 4 to 3.85% — the first hike in two years — is a significant bullish catalyst, turning the AUD-USD rate differential positive for the first time. Rising copper prices (+32% YoY) also provide commodity-currency support. However, the US-Iran war is a powerful headwind for risk-sensitive commodity currencies like the AUD, and mixed growth signals from China (NBS Manufacturing PMI at 49.3 in January) add further uncertainty. AUD/USD is at 0.7115, having rallied 7% from its January low over six consecutive weeks. The neutral score and low confidence (4/10) reflect the balanced but uncertain outlook. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE; INTRADAY mode, session hold (4/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen): Score +4 | BULLISH | Confidence 8/10**
The Japanese Yen is the highest-conviction trade in today's report, with two powerful and reinforcing bullish drivers. First, the Bank of Japan is in a tightening cycle, with the policy rate at 1.0% (raised at the January 2026 MPM) and strong expectations for another hike in April. This is narrowing the JPY-USD rate differential, which is structurally bullish for the yen. Second, the US-Iran war is a major geopolitical event that will trigger significant safe-haven flows into the Yen, which is one of the world's primary safe-haven currencies. USD/JPY is at 156.05, and a move toward 150-152 is plausible if the Iran conflict escalates. Note: 6J is quoted inversely — a bullish 6J score means JPY strengthening and USD/JPY falling. Signal decay note: the 6J bullish signal is expected to remain valid for 1-2 days; the BoJ tightening narrative provides a longer-term structural tailwind beyond the Iran war catalyst. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on any pullback; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (8/10).

## Key Macro Themes
The US-Israel launch of major combat operations against Iran on February 28, 2026 is the dominant market theme for today's session, introducing a geopolitical shock that overrides many of the existing fundamental narratives. The primary market implications are a surge in safe-haven demand (gold, JPY, USD Treasuries), a spike in oil prices due to Strait of Hormuz disruption fears, and a broad risk-off selloff in equities and commodity-linked currencies. The severity and duration of the conflict will determine whether this is a temporary shock or a sustained regime change in market conditions.

Real yields remain the dominant structural macro driver, with the 10-year TIPS yield at 1.74% (-6bps week-over-week), providing broad support for gold, silver, and duration-sensitive growth equities. The BoJ's hawkish normalization cycle — with the policy rate at 1.0% and April hike expectations building — represents the most significant central bank policy divergence in the current environment and is the primary structural driver of JPY strength.

The RBA's surprise rate hike to 3.85% on February 4 has created a new dynamic in the AUD-USD rate differential, turning it positive for the first time. However, this fundamental shift is being overshadowed by the broad risk-off environment driven by the Iran conflict, leaving the AUD in a state of equilibrium between competing forces.

## Watch List
The Iran conflict is the immediate focus — monitor for Iran's retaliation strategy, any attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz, and US/Israeli military response. A rapid de-escalation would reverse the safe-haven trades in GC, 6J, and CL. The next FOMC meeting is 18 days away (March 18-19, 2026), with the market pricing a 92.6% probability of no change. China's February PMI data is due March 2, which will be critical for the 6A outlook. OPEC+ meets on March 4-5, which could shift the oil supply narrative for CL. The BoJ's March and April policy meetings are key catalysts for 6J.
