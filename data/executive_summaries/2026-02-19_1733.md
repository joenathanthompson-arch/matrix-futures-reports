## Data Quality Notes
All data is fresh and has been verified from primary sources. No stale sources or fallbacks were used.

## Asset Class Overview
- **Commodities:** BULLISH - Broadly supported by a weaker US Dollar and specific factors like gold ETF inflows.
- **Indices:** BULLISH - A dovish Fed stance, narrowing credit spreads, and a weak dollar are providing a positive backdrop for equities.
- **FX:** BULLISH - A hawkish RBA and a broadly weaker dollar are supporting non-USD currencies.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a bullish bias (+3), primarily driven by a weaker USD and continued ETF inflows. The dovish Fed stance is also supportive. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver has a bullish bias (+3), tracking gold higher on the back of a weaker USD and ETF inflows. The absence of a strong catalyst from the industrial metals side, with copper being flat, presents a minor headwind. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (6/10).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil is showing a slight bullish bias (+1). A weaker USD and elevated geopolitical risk are providing support, however, a recent significant build in inventories is a notable bearish factor, creating a mixed picture. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (5/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 has a bullish bias (+3), supported by a dovish Fed, narrowing credit spreads, and a weaker USD. These factors combine to create a favorable environment for large-cap equities. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 shows a bullish bias (+4), with strong support from the outperforming semiconductor sector (SOX), falling interest rate volatility (MOVE), and a dovish Fed. This backdrop is particularly positive for technology and growth stocks. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones has a bullish bias (+4), benefiting from a steepening yield curve and narrowing credit spreads, which are constructive for cyclical and value-oriented stocks. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 has a strong bullish bias (+5), with all factors aligning positively. The narrowing of credit spreads is a particularly potent driver for small-cap companies, which are more sensitive to credit conditions. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (8/10).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro shows a slight bullish bias (+2), mainly as a result of a weaker US Dollar. However, the significant and persistent interest rate differential in favor of the USD is a major factor limiting the Euro's upside potential. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar has a bullish bias (+4), driven by a hawkish surprise from the Reserve Bank of Australia and a positive and widening interest rate differential against the US Dollar. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen has a neutral bias (0). A weak US Dollar is providing some support, but this is being offset by a very wide negative interest rate differential, which continues to be a major headwind for the Yen. Recommended approach: RANGE (5/10).

## Key Macro Themes
- A dovish hold from the Federal Reserve is supporting risk assets and commodities.
- Narrowing credit spreads are a bullish signal for equities, with small caps being a particular beneficiary.
- Broad-based US Dollar weakness is a tailwind for commodities and non-USD currencies.
- Strength in the semiconductor sector and falling interest rate volatility are providing strong support for technology stocks.

## Watch List
- Upcoming FOMC, CPI, and NFP data releases have the potential to shift the current market bias.
