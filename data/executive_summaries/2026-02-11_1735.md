# Executive Summary - February 11, 2026 (17:35 EST)

## Data Quality Notes

**Stale Sources:** EIA Oil Inventories (7 days old - week ending January 30, 2026)

**Fallbacks Used:** CNBC US10YTIP for real yields (FRED data was 2 days old)

All other macro data is current as of February 10-11, 2026. Data collection shows high quality with minimal staleness.

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities:** BULLISH - Precious metals showing strong bullish bias driven by falling real yields and USD weakness. Gold and silver both at strong bullish levels (+7 and +6 respectively). Crude oil showing modest bullish bias (+2) supported by inventory draws but limited by neutral supply conditions.

**Indices:** STRONG_BULLISH - All four equity indices showing strong bullish alignment with scores ranging from +6 to +8. Falling real yields, tight credit conditions, and declining VIX creating powerful tailwinds for risk assets. ES leads with +8 score.

**FX:** BULLISH - Foreign currencies benefiting from broad USD weakness. Australian dollar (+6) and Japanese yen (+6) showing particularly strong bullish bias driven by hawkish central bank stances relative to Fed. Euro (+2) showing modest gains primarily from USD weakness.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a strong bullish bias (+7), driven primarily by falling real yields (down 4.8 bps to 1.822%) and persistent USD weakness (DXY down 10.82% year-over-year). Gold ETF flows continue to show record inflows, with global holdings reaching all-time highs in January 2026. The dovish Fed stance (21% probability of March cut) and balanced risk environment provide additional support. With real yields weighted 2x in the scoring methodology, their decline is the dominant bullish catalyst. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on continued USD weakness (7/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver exhibits a strong bullish bias (+6), benefiting from the same precious metals tailwinds as gold while also gaining support from rising copper prices (+29% year-over-year). The hybrid nature of silver as both a precious and industrial metal creates dual support from falling real yields and strong industrial demand signals. USD weakness and gold ETF inflows provide additional momentum. The alignment of all major factors creates a clean bullish setup. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT following gold leadership (7/10).

**CL (Crude):** Crude oil shows a slight bullish bias (+2), with modest support from inventory draws (3.5 million barrel decrease week ending January 30) and USD weakness. However, the bullish case is limited by neutral oil supply conditions (no major disruptions), stable geopolitical risk, and stable growth narrative. The EIA data is 7 days old, reducing confidence in the inventory signal. Growth-weighted factors (2x weight) are neutral, limiting upside momentum. Recommended approach: RANGE_FADE until fresher supply data confirms directional bias (5/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 displays the strongest bullish bias across all indices (+8), driven by falling real yields (weighted 2x at +4 contribution), narrowing credit spreads (2.84%, near multi-year lows), and declining VIX (down 4.56% over 5 days). The dovish Fed stance and USD weakness provide additional tailwinds. With credit conditions healthy and volatility falling, the risk-reward setup strongly favors long exposure. The broad-based nature of the bullish signals increases conviction. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT with high conviction (8/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq):** Nasdaq shows a strong bullish bias (+7), with falling real yields (weighted 2x) providing the primary catalyst for growth-oriented tech stocks. Semiconductor strength (SOX up 60% year-over-year) confirms the tech sector's momentum. While the MOVE index shows mixed signals (short-term rise but long-term decline), the dominant trend in rate volatility remains downward, supporting duration-sensitive tech names. USD weakness and dovish Fed stance provide additional support. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT, particularly in mega-cap tech (8/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones shows a strong bullish bias (+6), supported by steepening yield curve (2s10s at +0.71%, up from deeply inverted levels), narrowing credit spreads, and falling real yields. The Dow's sensitivity to growth (weighted 2x) is neutral at current stable 3.7% GDPNow reading, but the curve steepening and credit conditions provide cyclical support. The Dow's lower beta relative to Nasdaq makes it an attractive vehicle when seeking equity exposure with reduced volatility. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT as a lower-beta equity play (7/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Russell 2000 exhibits a strong bullish bias (+7), with tight credit conditions (weighted 2x at +2 contribution) providing the key catalyst for small-cap strength. Credit spreads at 2.84% indicate healthy lending conditions, critical for leveraged small-cap companies. The steepening yield curve and falling real yields provide additional support. Small caps typically outperform in environments of easing financial conditions, which is precisely the current setup. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT with focus on credit-sensitive small caps (7/10).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro shows a slight bullish bias (+2), driven primarily by broad USD weakness (DXY down 10.82% year-over-year) rather than Euro-specific strength. Rate differentials remain neutral with both ECB and Fed on hold (ECB at 2.00%, Fed at 3.50-3.75%). Eurozone growth is stable with inflation at 1.7% (below 2% target). The dovish Fed stance provides modest support, but the lack of ECB hawkishness limits upside potential. The rate differential factor (weighted 2x) is neutral, capping the bullish score. Recommended approach: RANGE_FADE until clearer directional catalyst emerges (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian dollar shows a strong bullish bias (+6), with the RBA's February 3 rate hike to 3.85% (first hike since 2023) providing a major bullish catalyst. This hawkish shift while the Fed remains on hold creates a widening rate differential favoring AUD. Copper strength (+29% year-over-year) supports the commodity currency, though China growth remains stable rather than accelerating (weighted 2x at 0). USD weakness and the RBA's commitment to "do whatever it takes" on inflation suggest potential for additional rate hikes. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on central bank divergence theme (8/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese yen shows a strong bullish bias (+6), driven by the BoJ's gradual policy normalization (current rate 0.75%, highest in 30 years) while the Fed remains on hold. The rate differential factor (weighted 2x) contributes +2 as the BoJ-Fed gap narrows. BoJ policymakers calling for "timely rate hikes" in early February signal continued tightening bias. USD weakness provides additional support. Note that 6J quotes are inverted - bullish 6J means bullish JPY and bearish USD/JPY. The carry trade unwind theme remains in play. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on BoJ normalization continuation (7/10).

## Key Macro Themes

The dominant macro narrative is **falling real yields and USD weakness** creating broad-based support for risk assets, commodities, and foreign currencies. Real yields down 4.8 bps to 1.822% provide powerful tailwinds for duration-sensitive assets (tech, gold) while tight credit conditions (HY spreads at 2.84%) support leveraged assets (small caps, high yield). The Fed's dovish hold stance (21% probability of March cut) contrasts with hawkish moves from RBA and BoJ, creating central bank divergence opportunities in FX markets.

The **equity risk-reward setup is exceptionally favorable** with all four indices showing strong bullish bias. Falling VIX, narrowing credit spreads, and stable growth create a "Goldilocks" environment. However, traders should monitor for potential volatility around upcoming economic data releases that could shift Fed expectations.

**Commodity currencies (AUD) and safe-haven currencies (JPY) both showing strength** is an unusual alignment, suggesting the USD weakness theme is dominating traditional risk-on/risk-off dynamics. This creates opportunities in FX markets as central bank policy divergence becomes the primary driver.
