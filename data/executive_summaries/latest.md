## Overall Market Bias: BULLISH

US-Iran tensions are escalating with a 10-15 day nuclear deal deadline, adding a significant geopolitical risk premium to markets. This is supporting safe-haven assets like Gold, which has reclaimed the $5,000 level. A massive, unexpected draw in EIA crude inventories is providing a strong tailwind for oil prices. Meanwhile, falling real yields are supporting rate-sensitive assets like Gold and Tech, but a hawkish Fed and rising VIX are creating headwinds for broader equity indices.

## Key Macro Themes

1. **Geopolitical Risk Premium Returns**: The US-Iran nuclear deal deadline has injected significant uncertainty into the market, boosting safe-haven assets like Gold and adding a risk premium to Crude Oil. This is the dominant theme driving commodities.
2. **Divergent Central Bank Policies**: The BOJ and RBA are on hawkish paths, with expected and recent rate hikes strengthening their respective currencies (JPY, AUD). In contrast, the Fed is in a hawkish hold, and the ECB remains neutral, creating divergence and opportunities in FX markets.
3. **Growth vs. Inflation Tug-of-War**: Strong US growth (GDPNow 3.0%) and a hawkish Fed are creating headwinds for equities, while falling real yields provide support, particularly for the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The rising VIX indicates growing concern about this tension.
