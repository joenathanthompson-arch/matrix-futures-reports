## Overall Market Bias: BULLISH

The market exhibits a bullish sentiment, driven by falling real yields and declining bond market volatility, which creates a favorable environment for risk assets. Equities are broadly positive, supported by strong growth expectations and tight credit spreads. However, significant headwinds exist in the energy sector due to a massive inventory build, and geopolitical tensions surrounding US-Iran talks introduce a layer of uncertainty.

## Full Instrument Breakdown

### GC (Gold): +3 BULLISH (7/10)
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 1-2 days
Gold shows a solid bullish bias, primarily driven by falling real yields and recent ETF inflows. Rising geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran provide an additional tailwind for this safe-haven asset.

### SI (Silver): +3 BULLISH (6/10)
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 1-2 days
Silver's bullish case is supported by the same factors lifting gold, including falling real yields and a risk-on environment. The rising price of copper adds a positive industrial demand component to its outlook.

### CL (Crude Oil): -4 BEARISH (5/10)
**Approach:** IB_BREAKOUT | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session
A massive, unexpected build of 16 million barrels in weekly inventories has created significant bearish pressure. While geopolitical risks could cause price spikes, the overwhelming supply data suggests a bearish stance is warranted.

### ES (S&P 500): +5 STRONG_BULLISH (7/10)
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 2-5 days
The S&P 500 has a strong bullish bias. Falling real yields, very tight credit spreads, and a declining VIX create a highly supportive environment for equities, indicating broad market confidence.

### NQ (Nasdaq 100): +5 STRONG_BULLISH (7/10)
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 2-5 days
The Nasdaq is strongly bullish, benefiting significantly from falling real yields and declining bond market volatility (MOVE index). A rising semiconductor sector (SOX) further fuels positive momentum for tech-heavy index.

### YM (Dow Jones): +2 SLIGHT_BULLISH (6/10)
**Approach:** IB_BREAKOUT | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session
The Dow shows a slight bullish bias, supported by the general risk-on environment and a steepening yield curve. However, its sensitivity to accelerating growth presents a more mixed picture compared to other indices.

### RTY (Russell 2000): +3 BULLISH (7/10)
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 1-2 days
The Russell 2000 has a bullish outlook, strongly supported by tight credit spreads and a steepening yield curve. This indicates a healthy environment for smaller, domestically-focused companies.

### M6E (Euro): -1 SLIGHT_BEARISH (6/10)
**Approach:** RANGE_TRADE | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session
The Euro has a slight bearish tilt due to the negative interest rate differential with the US dollar. While Eurozone growth is showing signs of improvement, the Fed's higher policy rate remains a headwind.

### 6A (Australian Dollar): +2 SLIGHT_BULLISH (6/10)
**Approach:** IB_BREAKOUT | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session
The Aussie dollar is slightly bullish, benefiting from the broad risk-on sentiment and rising copper prices. The RBA's recent rate hike provides some support, though the overall picture is one of cautious optimism.

### 6J (Japanese Yen): +4 BULLISH (7/10)
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 1-2 days
The Yen has a clear bullish bias, driven by the Bank of Japan's increasingly hawkish stance and the narrowing interest rate differential against the US dollar. This policy divergence is a strong fundamental driver.

## Key Macro Themes

1. **Accommodative Financial Conditions**: Falling real yields, a declining VIX, and tight credit spreads are creating a strong tailwind for risk assets like equities.
2. **Crude Oil Oversupply**: A massive and unexpected build in crude inventories is the dominant factor for oil, creating significant bearish pressure despite geopolitical noise.
3. **Central Bank Divergence**: The Bank of Japan's clear hawkish pivot contrasts with the Fed's and ECB's neutral stance, making the Yen (6J) a standout with a strong directional bias.
