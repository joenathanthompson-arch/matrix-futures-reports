## Data Quality Notes

All primary sources confirmed. FRED data reflects standard 1-business-day publication lag (DFII10, BAMLH0A0HYM2, T10Y2Y). Real yields confirmed in real-time via CNBC US10YTIP at 1.766% (07:39 AM EST), consistent with the falling trend. SOX and MOVE reflect prior session close (Feb 25). This report corrects two factor errors from the 0235 report: HY OAS credit spreads are **widening** (2.84% → 2.97%, not narrowing), and the 2s10s yield curve is **flattening** (0.64% → 0.60%, not steepening). BoJ stance upgraded to Hawkish based on policymaker Takata's Feb 26 statement calling for continuing rate hikes, and ex-BoJ chief Kuroda's Feb 25 call for rate hikes and tighter fiscal policy.

## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** MIXED — Metals (GC, SI) are BULLISH driven by falling real yields and gold ETF inflows, but crude oil (CL) is deeply BEARISH on a massive +16MB inventory build and easing supply conditions. The 2-1 bullish split meets the majority threshold, but CL's deep bearish score (-4) warrants a MIXED classification.
- **Indices:** MIXED — Tech (NQ STRONG_BULLISH +5, ES BULLISH +3) benefits from falling real yields and collapsing rate vol (MOVE -8% weekly), but cyclicals (YM SLIGHT_BEARISH -2, RTY SLIGHT_BEARISH -3) face headwinds from widening credit spreads and a flattening yield curve. The index bloc is split 2-2 bullish/bearish.
- **FX:** BULLISH — All three FX instruments lean bullish: 6J (+4) and 6A (+3) driven by BoJ/RBA hawkishness, M6E (+1) supported by accelerating Eurozone PMI. All three meet the BULLISH/SLIGHT_BULLISH threshold.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold scores BULLISH (+3, confidence 8/10). The primary driver is falling real yields — the 10-year TIPS yield has declined approximately 9 basis points over the past two weeks to 1.766% (confirmed via CNBC real-time at 07:39 EST), which carries double weight in the gold model and contributes +4 to the score. Gold ETF inflows remain robust with global AUM at all-time highs and GLD recording $276M in inflows last week. The only headwinds are accelerating US growth (GDPNow 3.1%, contributing -1) and easing oil supply (contributing -1). Gold spot is near $5,179/oz. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or WITH_TREND long (8/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver scores BULLISH (+3, confidence 7/10). Silver benefits from the same falling real yield tailwind as gold (contributing +2), with additional support from rising copper prices (+3.94% weekly, +16% over 3 months) confirming industrial demand strength (contributing +1). Gold ETF inflows provide a sympathetic bid (+1). The accelerating growth narrative is a mild headwind (-1). Silver is a hybrid precious/industrial metal and can whipsaw on regime changes, but the current alignment of both precious and industrial drivers is constructive. Recommended approach: WITH_TREND long, smaller size than GC given higher volatility (7/10).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude scores BEARISH (-4, confidence 8/10). The EIA weekly report (week ending Feb 20) showed a massive +16.0 million barrel inventory build, bringing total US crude stocks to 435.8 million barrels. Oil supply conditions are easing (refinery utilization 89.9%, production 15.9 mb/d), contributing -2 at double weight. The inventory build contributes -1, and accelerating US growth (GDPNow 3.1%) contributes -2 at double weight. The only bullish offset is rising geopolitical risk from US-Iran nuclear tensions (+1). WTI spot was $66.69/barrel as of Feb 20. Recommended approach: WITH_TREND short or FADE_RALLY on bounces (8/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** ES scores BULLISH (+3, confidence 7/10). The dominant driver is falling real yields (weight 2x, contributing +4). VIX is falling today (-0.84%), adding +1. These bullish factors are partially offset by widening HY credit spreads (2.84% → 2.97%, contributing -1) and accelerating growth narrative (contributing -1). The net result is a constructive bias for large-cap equities. The credit spread widening is a key risk to monitor — if HY OAS continues to widen, it could reduce this score. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or WITH_TREND long, with credit spread widening as the primary downside risk (7/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** NQ scores STRONG_BULLISH (+5, confidence 8/10). This is the highest-conviction signal in today's report. The combination of falling real yields (weight 2x, contributing +4), a surging SOX semiconductor index (+1.62% yesterday, +4.42% weekly, contributing +1), and a collapsing MOVE rate volatility index (-4.35% yesterday, -8.23% weekly, contributing +1) creates an exceptionally favorable environment for growth/tech equities. The accelerating growth narrative is the only headwind (-1). The tech regime is intact. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or WITH_TREND long — half-size on first entry given NQ's higher beta (8/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** YM scores SLIGHT_BEARISH (-2, confidence 7/10). While falling real yields provide a +2 tailwind, this is more than offset by accelerating growth (weight 2x, contributing -2), widening credit spreads (-1), and a flattening yield curve (-1). The Dow's value/cyclical composition makes it more sensitive to credit conditions and yield curve dynamics than tech-heavy indices. The 2s10s curve has flattened from 0.64% to 0.60% over the past two weeks, which is a headwind for the financial and industrial components of the Dow. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLY or stand aside; prefer NQ/ES long over YM (7/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** RTY scores SLIGHT_BEARISH (-3, confidence 7/10). Small caps are the most credit-sensitive instrument in the portfolio. The widening HY OAS (2.84% → 2.97%, weight 2x, contributing -2) and flattening yield curve (contributing -1) are significant headwinds for small-cap companies that rely heavily on bank lending and high-yield markets. Accelerating growth (weight 2x, contributing -2) further pressures the score. Falling real yields provide a +2 offset, but it is insufficient to overcome the credit and curve headwinds. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLY or avoid long; credit spread widening is the key risk factor to monitor (7/10).

**M6E (Micro Euro FX):** M6E scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+1, confidence 6/10). The ECB held rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting at 2.00%, while the Fed is also on hold — the rate differential is stable (not widening or narrowing), scoring 0. The key bullish driver is accelerating Eurozone growth: the S&P Global Flash PMI composite reached 51.9 in February (a 14-month high) and manufacturing PMI hit a 44-month high, contributing +1. The USD is flat on the week. The overall bias is modestly constructive for EUR/USD. Recommended approach: WITH_TREND long on pullbacks, low conviction (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** 6A scores BULLISH (+3, confidence 7/10). The RBA delivered a unanimous 25bp rate hike to 3.85% on February 3, 2026, making it the most hawkish major central bank. This pushes the AUD cash rate above the Fed funds rate, creating a positive rate differential (contributing +1 each for RBA stance and rate differential). Copper prices are rising strongly (+3.94% weekly, +16% over 3 months), supporting the commodity-linked AUD (+1). China's PMI data is mixed (NBS 49.3 contraction, Caixin 50.3 expansion), scoring neutral. Risk sentiment is balanced (VIX 17.78). Recommended approach: WITH_TREND long (7/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** 6J scores BULLISH (+4, confidence 7/10). The BoJ raised its policy rate to 1.0% at the January 2026 MPM and is in an active tightening cycle. Today (Feb 26), BoJ policymaker Hajime Takata explicitly called for continuing rate hikes; yesterday, ex-BoJ chief Kuroda also called for rate hikes and tighter fiscal policy. This hawkish stance (weight 2x, contributing +2) combined with a widening rate differential in JPY's favor (BoJ hiking while Fed holds, weight 2x, contributing +2) creates a strong bullish case for the yen. Recall: 6J quotes are inverted — BULLISH 6J = BEARISH USD/JPY. Signal decay expected within 1-2 weeks as BoJ next meeting approaches. Recommended approach: WITH_TREND long 6J (short USD/JPY) (7/10).

## Key Macro Themes

**Theme 1 — Rate Regime Divergence Driving FX:** The BoJ and RBA are both in active tightening cycles while the Fed is on hold. This creates the clearest directional trades in the portfolio: long 6J (BULLISH +4) and long 6A (BULLISH +3). The BoJ's hawkish pivot is the most significant macro development of the past 48 hours, with multiple policymakers calling for continued rate hikes on Feb 25-26. This is a correction from the 0235 report, which scored BoJ as Neutral; the Feb 26 policymaker statements confirm the Hawkish stance.

**Theme 2 — Tech Outperforming Cyclicals:** Falling real yields and collapsing rate volatility (MOVE -8% weekly) are creating a favorable environment for growth/tech (NQ STRONG_BULLISH +5, ES BULLISH +3) while cyclicals and small caps face headwinds from widening credit spreads and a flattening yield curve (YM SLIGHT_BEARISH -2, RTY SLIGHT_BEARISH -3). The SOX semiconductor index is up +4.42% on the week, confirming tech leadership. This divergence is a key theme: do not treat the index bloc as uniformly bullish.

**Theme 3 — Energy Supply Glut vs. Geopolitical Premium:** Crude oil faces a fundamental bearish case (massive +16MB inventory build, easing supply) but US-Iran nuclear tensions are providing a geopolitical risk premium. The net score is BEARISH (-4) with the geopolitical factor providing only a partial +1 offset. Traders should monitor US-Iran developments closely as an escalation could rapidly shift the CL bias.

## Watch List

- **US-Iran Nuclear Talks (Feb 26, 2026):** Ongoing negotiations with elevated military risk. US officials warned of Iranian nuclear threat today. An escalation or breakdown could sharply shift CL bias from BEARISH to BULLISH. Monitor closely.
- **BoJ Next Meeting (March 2026):** BoJ policymakers are signaling continued rate hikes. The next MPM will be a key catalyst for 6J. Signal decay for 6J high-conviction score expected within 1-2 weeks.
- **EIA Weekly Petroleum Report (Next: March 4, 2026):** Consecutive large inventory builds would reinforce CL BEARISH bias. A draw would reduce conviction.
- **US PCE Inflation (Feb 27, 2026):** Core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. A hot print could shift Fed stance from Neutral to Hawkish Hold, negatively impacting GC, NQ, and ES.
- **Atlanta Fed GDPNow Updates:** Currently at 3.1% for Q1 2026. If this continues to accelerate, it could push growth narrative further into "Accelerating" territory, adding headwinds for cyclicals.
- **HY Credit Spreads:** HY OAS has widened from 2.84% to 2.97% over 2 weeks. A continued widening above 3.10% would shift credit spreads to a more significant headwind for ES, YM, and RTY.
