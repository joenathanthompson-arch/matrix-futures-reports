## Data Quality Notes

FRED DFII10 (real yields) and BAMLH0A0HYM2 (HY OAS) are 2 business days old (last updated Feb 25, 2026), which is within the normal FRED lag window. Real-time fallbacks confirmed via TradingView (MOVE, SOX, DXY) and Investing.com (copper). VIX updated to 20.04 from the earlier 0230 slot reading of 18.62, reflecting overnight deterioration in risk sentiment driven by a Nvidia-led tech rout.

## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** SLIGHT_BULLISH — Gold and silver maintain bullish momentum on falling real yields, ETF inflows, and safe-haven demand from US-Iran tensions. Crude oil remains bearish following the massive +16.0M barrel EIA inventory build, but geopolitical risk limits the downside.
- **Indices:** SLIGHT_BULLISH — Falling real yields and narrowing credit spreads provide a macro tailwind, but the Nvidia-led tech rout and rising VIX (20.04) create headwinds. Intraday breakout strategies are preferred over swing trades for indices today.
- **FX:** SLIGHT_BULLISH — The BoJ's accelerating hawkish pivot is the dominant FX theme, driving a strong bullish signal for 6J. The RBA's hawkish hike and rising copper support 6A. The Euro remains neutral, caught between improving Eurozone PMI data and a wide rate differential versus the USD.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold): Score +3 | BULLISH | Confidence 8/10**

Gold's bullish case is well-supported by a confluence of macro factors. The 10-year TIPS real yield (DFII10) stands at 1.77%, having fallen materially from recent highs — the primary driver of gold's sustained rally. Global gold ETFs have attracted over $18 billion in inflows year-to-date through February 20, with the SPDR Gold Shares ETF alone receiving $2.58 billion in January. Geopolitical risk from US tariffs (now at 15% globally) and ongoing US-Iran tensions provide additional safe-haven demand. Gold is on track for a seventh consecutive month of gains, with spot at $5,209/oz (+0.65% today). Signal decay note: this signal is expected to remain valid for 2-5 days; monitor real yield direction and tariff headline risk for any catalyst shift. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on pullbacks toward key support; SWING mode, 2-5 day hold (8/10).

**SI (Silver): Score +3 | BULLISH | Confidence 7/10**

Silver mirrors gold's bullish setup with the added industrial tailwind of copper at $6.12/lb (+3.8% this week, +18.5% over three months), confirming reflation demand in base metals. Falling real yields and gold ETF inflows support the precious metals complex broadly. Silver is up +3.44% today at $90.52/oz, outperforming gold on the session, which is consistent with a risk-on precious metals environment. Confidence is one notch below gold due to silver's higher beta and greater sensitivity to growth expectations. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW, half-size on first entry; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (7/10).

**CL (WTI Crude): Score -3 | BEARISH | Confidence 5/10**

Crude oil carries a bearish signal driven by the EIA's reported +16.0 million barrel crude inventory build for the week ending February 20 — the largest single-week build in recent months, pushing total commercial crude stocks to 435.8 million barrels. WTI is trading at approximately $66.38, recovering modestly from recent lows. The bearish supply picture is partially offset by geopolitical risk (Middle East tensions, US-Iran talks) and a weak USD. The net score of -3 reflects a bearish lean, but confidence is limited to 5/10 given the competing forces. Signal decay note: the OPEC+ meeting on March 4-5 is the key near-term catalyst that could sharply reverse this bias. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE between key support/resistance levels; INTRADAY mode, session hold (5/10).

**ES (S&P 500): Score +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 5/10**

The S&P 500 faces a tug-of-war between macro tailwinds and near-term sentiment headwinds. Falling real yields (double-weighted, +4 contribution) and narrowing HY credit spreads are supportive. However, the Nvidia-led tech rout has pushed futures lower pre-market, with S&P 500 futures down approximately 0.2% ahead of the open. VIX is rising (20.04, up +7.57% on the day) and the US PPI data at 8:30 AM EST is a key near-term catalyst. The S&P 500 is on pace for a monthly loss in February. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT — wait for the Initial Balance to form in the first hour of trading, then trade the breakout direction; INTRADAY mode, session hold (5/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100): Score +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 5/10**

Nasdaq's macro backdrop is similar to ES, with falling real yields providing a discount rate tailwind for long-duration growth assets. However, the Nvidia-led tech rout is a direct headwind — NVDA fell -5.46% yesterday, and the SOX semiconductor index closed at 8,197 (-3.19%). The Nasdaq is on track for its steepest monthly fall in recent memory. MOVE index at 63.93 (rising) adds rate volatility as a further headwind. The slight bullish bias reflects the macro backdrop, but conviction is low. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT, half-size only; INTRADAY mode, session hold (5/10).

**YM (Dow Jones): Score +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**

The Dow's value-oriented composition makes it less sensitive to the tech-specific headwinds affecting NQ. Falling real yields, narrowing credit spreads, and a steepening 2s10s yield curve (60 bps) are all supportive. The Dow is actually on pace for a monthly gain in February, outperforming the tech-heavy indices. Tariff uncertainty and rising VIX limit the conviction for a swing trade. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000): Score +3 | BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**

Small caps are particularly sensitive to domestic credit conditions, making the narrowing HY OAS (2.94%, near multi-year lows) a strong positive driver. The steepening 2s10s yield curve (60 bps) is also beneficial for small-cap financials. The Russell 2000 is up +0.52% today, outperforming large-cap indices. Tariff risk is a concern for domestic manufacturers, but the credit environment remains supportive. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on dips; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (6/10).

**6E (Euro FX): Score 0 | NEUTRAL | Confidence 6/10**

The Euro is in a state of equilibrium. The primary headwind is the rate differential: the Fed funds rate at 3.75% versus the ECB's 2.00% deposit rate creates a 175 bps advantage for the USD. However, improving Eurozone economic data (Composite PMI at 51.9 in February, a 44-month high in manufacturing) and a weakening USD (DXY YTD -0.53%) provide offsetting support. EUR/USD is trading at approximately 1.1801, rangebound near the 50-day EMA. The ECB is expected to hold rates through 2026. Recommended approach: FADE_RANGE — sell rallies toward 1.1850 resistance and buy dips toward 1.16 support; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar): Score +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**

The Australian Dollar is finding support from multiple sources. The RBA's hawkish rate hike to 3.85% at its February meeting has brought its policy rate nearly in line with the Fed, neutralizing the rate differential headwind. Copper's strong performance (+3.8% this week) is a positive for AUD given Australia's commodity export profile. The DXY's weakness provides an additional tailwind. AUD/USD is trading near 0.713, with Credit Agricole raising its mid-2026 forecast to 0.73. Mixed signals from China's PMI data (private 50.3, official 49.3) temper conviction. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on dips toward 0.70 support; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (6/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen): Score +5 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence 8/10**

The Japanese Yen carries the highest conviction bullish signal in today's report. The Bank of Japan's hawkish pivot is accelerating: BoJ board member Takata (the most hawkish member) renewed his call for rate hikes on February 26, citing inflation overshoot risk, and Governor Ueda has hinted at further hikes despite recent dovish board appointments. Japan's 10-year government bond yield has risen to approximately 2.16%, marking a third consecutive session of gains. USD/JPY is trading at 155.79, declining on the day as the JPY strengthens. The rate differential is narrowing as the BoJ tightens while the Fed holds. Safe-haven demand from tariff uncertainty provides an additional tailwind. Signal decay note: this signal is expected to remain valid for 2-5 days; the next BoJ meeting on March 20 is the key catalyst — the signal may decay if the BoJ signals a pause. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on USD/JPY pullbacks (selling USD/JPY); SWING mode, 2-5 day hold (8/10).

## Key Macro Themes

1. **Real Yield Compression Driving Precious Metals:** The 10-year TIPS real yield at 1.77% (DFII10, Feb 25) is the dominant bullish factor for gold and silver. This compression reflects market expectations for eventual Fed easing and inflation remaining contained, even as nominal growth accelerates. Gold is on track for a seventh consecutive monthly gain.

2. **BoJ Hawkish Pivot Accelerating:** The Bank of Japan's policy normalization is gaining momentum, with hawkish board member Takata calling for rate hikes and Governor Ueda signaling continued tightening. This is the primary driver of the strong bullish signal for 6J and represents a structural shift in the global rate differential landscape.

3. **Crude Oil Supply Glut Overwhelming Demand Signals:** The +16.0M barrel EIA inventory build is the largest bearish catalyst in this report. With WTI at $66.38 and OPEC+ meeting March 4-5, the path of least resistance for crude is lower unless geopolitical disruption materializes or OPEC announces deeper cuts.

4. **Tariff Uncertainty Capping Risk Appetite:** The Trump administration's 15% global import tariff is creating a ceiling on risk asset rallies. The Nvidia-led tech rout and rising VIX (20.04) reflect this uncertainty. Indices are biased slightly bullish on macro fundamentals but require intraday breakout confirmation rather than swing positioning.
