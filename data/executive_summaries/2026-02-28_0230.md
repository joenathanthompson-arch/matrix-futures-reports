# Executive Summary - February 28, 2026 | 0230 EST

## Data Quality Notes

All primary data sources were current and fresh as of this report. FRED DFII10 (real yields) and BAMLH0A0HYM2 (HY OAS) data are current through February 26, 2026, which is within the acceptable 1-business-day lag. No fallback sources were required. MOVE index and SOX data sourced from TradingView in real time. Copper price sourced from Investing.com. Gold ETF flow data sourced from World Gold Council and Seeking Alpha (GLD weekly flows). EIA crude inventory data from week ending February 20, released February 25, 2026.

## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** BULLISH — Gold and silver both score +4 (BULLISH) driven by falling real yields and continued ETF inflows. Crude oil is the outlier at -2 (SLIGHT_BEARISH) due to the massive +16M barrel inventory build, though geopolitical risk from US-Iran tensions provides a partial offset.
- **Indices:** SLIGHT_BULLISH — All four equity indices score positive, with ES and NQ at +2, YM at +1, and RTY at 0 (NEUTRAL). Falling real yields are the primary tailwind, while widening credit spreads and a rising MOVE index are headwinds. Russell 2000 is the weakest link given its sensitivity to credit conditions.
- **FX:** BULLISH — All three FX instruments score positive. The Japanese Yen and Euro are the standouts at +4 and +3 respectively, driven by BoJ hawkish pivot and DXY weakness. The Australian Dollar is a mild +1 as the RBA hike is partially offset by China growth concerns.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH) with high conviction (7/10), driven primarily by falling real yields — the 10-year TIPS yield (DFII10) dropped 6 basis points over the week to 1.74%, the lowest level in recent weeks. Gold ETF inflows remain robust with over $18 billion in year-to-date global flows through February 20, and GLD recorded $276 million in inflows last week alone. The Fed's neutral hold stance and a flat DXY provide a supportive backdrop. The only headwind is a slightly negative oil supply signal from the massive crude inventory build, which has minimal direct impact on gold. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH) with moderate conviction (6/10), benefiting from the same falling real yield environment as gold while also receiving support from a strongly rising copper market — copper futures gained +3.20% over the past week and +17.82% over three months, signaling robust industrial demand expectations. Gold ETF inflows also provide a positive spillover to silver. The balanced VIX (19.86) and neutral growth narrative keep conviction below gold's level, as silver is more sensitive to risk sentiment swings. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (6/10).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil shows a slight bearish bias (-2, SLIGHT_BEARISH) with high conviction (7/10), as the dominant signal is the massive +16 million barrel crude inventory build reported by the EIA for the week ending February 20 — far exceeding the +1.2 million barrel consensus expectation and the largest build in recent memory. US production at 13.702 million bpd remains near record highs. The partial offset comes from rising geopolitical risk: US-Iran nuclear talks in Geneva on February 26 failed to make progress, with Iran not meeting core US demands, and analysts estimate a $4-10/bbl geopolitical risk premium is embedded in prices. The stable GDPNow estimate of 3.0% for Q1 2026 provides a neutral demand backdrop. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLY (7/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 E-mini shows a slight bullish bias (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH) with moderate conviction (6/10). The primary tailwind is falling real yields, which provide a +4 weighted contribution to the score. However, two meaningful headwinds are present: credit spreads (HY OAS) have widened from 2.86% to 2.98% over the past week, signaling some stress in risk appetite, and the VIX rose +6.61% on February 27 to close at 19.86, indicating increasing market anxiety. The MOVE index surging +14.79% in a single session to 73.38 adds further uncertainty for rate-sensitive equities. The Fed's neutral hold and stable growth narrative (GDPNow 3.0%) provide a floor. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 E-mini shows a slight bullish bias (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH) with moderate conviction (6/10), matching ES but with different dynamics. Falling real yields are particularly important for high-duration tech stocks, contributing +4 to the weighted score. The headwinds are the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) falling -1.21% on February 27 and -2.28% over the past month, which is a direct negative signal for Nasdaq's largest sector, and the MOVE index spike to 73.38 (+14.79%), which raises rate volatility concerns. NQ is the highest-beta index and warrants caution on position sizing. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones E-mini shows a slight bullish bias (+1, SLIGHT_BULLISH) with moderate conviction (6/10). The Dow benefits from falling real yields (+2 weighted contribution) but is less sensitive to semiconductor weakness than NQ. The primary headwind is widening credit spreads (-1), which can weigh on the financial and industrial sectors that dominate the Dow. The yield curve remains flat (2s10s at 0.59%), providing a neutral signal for banks. The Dow's lower beta relative to NQ makes it a cleaner vehicle when rate volatility is elevated. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 E-mini shows a neutral bias (0, NEUTRAL) with moderate conviction (6/10). While falling real yields provide a +2 contribution, the double-weighted credit spread factor (-2 weighted) neutralizes this entirely, reflecting the Russell's well-documented sensitivity to credit conditions — small-cap companies rely heavily on bank lending and high-yield markets, making them the most vulnerable when HY OAS widens. The 2s10s curve at 0.59% is flat, providing no additional steepening tailwind. With credit spreads widening from 2.86% to 2.98% over the past week, the risk-reward for RTY longs is unfavorable relative to the larger-cap indices. Recommended approach: AVOID or FADE_RALLY (6/10).

**M6E (Micro Euro FX):** The Micro Euro FX shows a bullish bias (+3, BULLISH) with moderate conviction (6/10). The primary driver is the rate differential dynamic: while both the Fed (3.50-3.75%) and ECB (2.75-2.90%) are on hold, the DXY has fallen -0.60% year-to-date and -8.96% over the past year, reflecting a structural USD weakening trend that benefits EUR/USD. The Eurozone economic picture has improved, with the composite PMI rising to 51.9 in February (from 51.3 in January) and manufacturing PMI returning to expansion at 50.8 (from 49.5). Both central banks holding rates creates a stable rate differential environment, but the USD's secular decline is the key bullish driver for M6E. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar shows a slight bullish bias (+1, SLIGHT_BULLISH) with moderate conviction (6/10). The RBA's surprise unanimous rate hike on February 3 to 3.85% — the first hike in two years — is the primary bullish catalyst, and with the AUD rate now above the Fed rate, the rate differential has turned favorable for AUD. Rising copper prices (+17.82% over three months) also provide commodity-currency support. The significant headwind is China's economic data: the NBS Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.3 in January (below the 50 expansion threshold), and February PMI is expected to decline further, which directly weighs on Australia's largest trading partner and commodity export demand. Recommended approach: FADE_WEAKNESS (6/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen shows a bullish bias (+4, BULLISH) with high conviction (7/10). The BoJ hawkish pivot is the dominant driver: multiple BoJ officials including policymaker Takata called for continued rate hikes on February 26, the BOJ chief flagged March/April as potential hike windows, and overnight swaps now price a 68% probability of a rate hike by April. The current BoJ rate of 0.75% is expected to rise to 1.0% at the January MPM, with further hikes to 1.5-1.75% possible in coming years. This narrowing of the JPY-USD rate differential is structurally bullish for the yen (bearish USD/JPY). Note: 6J is quoted inversely — a bullish 6J score means JPY strengthening and USD/JPY falling. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

## Key Macro Themes

Real yields are the dominant macro driver this week, with the 10-year TIPS yield falling 6 basis points to 1.74%, providing broad support for gold, silver, and duration-sensitive equities while the Fed maintains its neutral hold stance with a 92.6% probability of no change at the March FOMC meeting.

The BoJ's hawkish pivot represents the most significant central bank policy divergence in the current environment, with multiple officials publicly advocating for continued rate hikes and market pricing reflecting a 68% probability of an April hike — this is the primary driver of JPY strength and the FX class's bullish bias.

US-Iran geopolitical tensions remain elevated following failed nuclear talks in Geneva on February 26, creating a $4-10/bbl risk premium in crude oil that partially offsets the bearish signal from the massive +16 million barrel EIA inventory build — the MOVE index's +14.79% single-session spike to 73.38 reflects broader market anxiety about rate volatility and geopolitical uncertainty.

## Watch List

The next FOMC meeting is 18 days away (March 18-19, 2026), with the market pricing a 92.6% probability of no change — any shift in Fed communication or incoming data (PCE, NFP) that alters this expectation would be a significant market mover. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow will be updated on March 2, 2026, and any significant revision to the current 3.0% Q1 estimate would impact the growth narrative across all instruments. The BoJ's March and April policy meetings are key catalysts for 6J, with the April meeting currently the most likely venue for the next rate hike to 1.0%. China's February PMI data (due March 2) will be critical for the 6A outlook given the current bearish China growth signal. OPEC+ meets on March 4-5, which could shift the oil supply narrative for CL.
