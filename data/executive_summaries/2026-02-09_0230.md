# Executive Summary - 2026-02-09 02:30 EST

## Data Quality Notes
- FRED data for 10-Year TIPS (DFII10) was stale (3 days old). Real-time data from CNBC was used as a fallback.

## Asset Class Overview
- **Commodities:** MIXED - A bullish stance on Crude Oil driven by inventory draws and a weak dollar is offset by a bearish outlook for Gold due to rising real yields.
- **Indices:** MIXED - A bearish view on tech-heavy indices (ES, NQ) due to rising real yields is countered by a slightly bullish outlook for value and small-cap indices (YM, RTY) which are benefiting from a steepening yield curve and tight credit spreads.
- **FX:** BULLISH - A broadly weaker US Dollar is providing a tailwind for all major FX pairs, particularly commodity-linked currencies like the Australian Dollar.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a slight bearish bias (-2), primarily driven by the significant headwind from sharply rising real yields. While a weaker US Dollar and continued ETF inflows provide some support, the impact of higher real rates is the dominant factor. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLIES (6/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver has a slight bullish bias (+1), finding itself in a tug-of-war. Rising real yields are a negative, but this is counteracted by a weaker USD, strong industrial demand indicated by rising copper prices, and positive sentiment from gold ETF inflows. Recommended approach: SCALPING_LONG (6/10).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude Oil exhibits a bullish bias (+3), supported by a confluence of positive factors. A larger-than-expected inventory draw, rising geopolitical risk premium, and a weaker US Dollar all provide strong tailwinds for the price of oil. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 has a slight bearish bias (-2). The primary driver is the sharp increase in real yields, which pressures equity valuations. While tight credit spreads and a weak dollar are supportive, the impact of higher rates is the dominant factor for the broad market. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLIES (6/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 shows a slight bearish bias (-3), being the most sensitive to the rise in real yields. The increase in the MOVE index, indicating higher interest rate volatility, also acts as a headwind for long-duration tech stocks, despite a strong SOX index. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLIES (6/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones has a slight bullish bias (+1). It is less sensitive to real yields and is benefiting from the steepening yield curve and tight credit spreads, which are positive for cyclical and financial stocks. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 displays a bullish bias (+2). Small-cap stocks are highly sensitive to credit conditions, and the narrowing of high-yield spreads provides a significant boost. A steepening yield curve also supports this domestically-focused index. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro has a slight bullish bias (+1), primarily as a reflection of broad US Dollar weakness. With limited fresh information on ECB policy or Eurozone growth, the dollar's trend is the main driver. Recommended approach: SCALPING_LONG (5/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar shows a bullish bias (+2). This risk-sensitive currency is benefiting from two key tailwinds: a weaker US Dollar and rising copper prices, which signal strong global growth and demand for Australian exports. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen has a slight bullish bias (+1). As a safe-haven currency, it benefits from rising geopolitical risk. The primary driver, however, is the broad-based weakness in the US Dollar. Recommended approach: SCALPING_LONG (5/10).

## Key Macro Themes
- The primary conflict in the market is between rising real yields (bearish for risk assets) and a weakening US Dollar (bullish for risk assets).
- Credit spreads remain tight, suggesting the market is not pricing in significant default risk, which is supportive for equities, particularly small caps.
- Geopolitical tensions are simmering, providing a low-level bid for safe-haven assets like Gold and the Japanese Yen.

## Watch List
- Upcoming commentary from Fed officials for any change in tone regarding the recent rise in real yields.
- Next EIA petroleum report to see if inventory draws continue.
- Developments in US-Iran and US-Europe relations.
