# Executive Summary - February 20, 2026 (1930 EST)

## Data Quality Notes

All primary sources were accessed or verified via fallback. FRED DFII10 and BAMLH0A0HYM2 carry a 1-day lag (Feb 19 data), which is within the acceptable staleness window. MOVE and SOX data sourced from TradingView (fallback from Yahoo Finance). Gold ETF flows reflect January 2026 monthly data (most recent available from World Gold Council). Geopolitical risk assessment is based on CBOE VIX commentary referencing US strikes and Iran response uncertainty. All scores are integers per methodology.

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities: BULLISH** — All three commodity instruments score bullish or slight-bullish. The dominant catalyst is the EIA crude inventory draw of -9.0 million barrels (vs. +1.65M expected), the steepest draw since early September, combined with elevated US-Iran geopolitical risk. Gold and silver benefit from USD weakness and persistent ETF inflows (8 consecutive months of inflows through January 2026).

**Indices: MIXED** — US equity signals are split. Tech-oriented NQ (+2) and ES (+1) remain slight-bullish, supported by a falling VIX (-5.64%), strong SOX (+1.07%), and falling MOVE index. However, YM (-2) and RTY (-2) are slight-bearish, weighed down by the accelerating GDPNow estimate (3.1%, above trend) which is double-weighted for these instruments, and a flattening yield curve (2s10s: 0.74 → 0.60 over two weeks). The divergence between large-cap tech and value/small-cap is the defining theme.

**FX: BULLISH** — All three FX instruments are bullish or strong-bullish. The JPY thesis is the highest-conviction call of the session: the BoJ is in an active tightening cycle (current rate 0.75%, expected to reach 1% by June 2026), and the JPY-USD rate differential is narrowing as the Fed is expected to cut ~50bps in 2026. The EUR benefits from the ECB-Fed policy divergence (ECB holding at 2.15% while Fed cuts). The AUD is supported by the RBA's surprise February 3rd hike to 3.85%, though China's slowing growth (official PMI 49.3, below 50) limits upside.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold scores +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH, 7/10 confidence). The primary drivers are USD weakness (DXY -0.83% on the month, -8.71% year-over-year) and persistent gold ETF inflows — global gold ETFs added 120 tonnes in January 2026, their eighth consecutive month of inflows, pushing AUM to a record $669bn. Real yields are flat (DFII10 at 1.79%, ±1bp over 5 days), providing a neutral backdrop. The accelerating GDPNow estimate (3.1%) is a mild headwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10). GLD is up ~+1.97% today at 468.62.

**SI (Silver):** Silver scores +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH, 7/10 confidence). Silver is the strongest performer today, up +6.07% (SI at 82.343), driven by the same USD weakness and gold ETF inflow tailwinds as GC, amplified by rising copper (+1.75% today, +15.66% over 3 months). The industrial demand signal from copper is particularly supportive. Conflicting signal: accelerating growth narrative is a mild negative. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10). The magnitude of today's move warrants caution on chasing; look for pullback entries.

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude scores +3 (BULLISH, 7/10 confidence). The dominant catalyst is the EIA weekly report (Feb 19) showing a -9.0 million barrel draw for the week ending Feb 13 — a massive surprise against expectations of a +1.65M build and the steepest draw since early September. US-Iran geopolitical tensions (US strikes over the weekend, Iran response pending) add a risk premium. USD weakness provides additional support. The only headwind is the accelerating GDPNow (3.1%), which is double-weighted for CL and offsets some of the bullish signal. WTI was trading near $66.65 at time of report. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** ES scores +1 (SLIGHT_BULLISH, 6/10 confidence). The session closed at 6,909.52 (+0.69%). Positive drivers include a falling VIX (-5.64% to 19.09) and USD weakness. Real yields are flat (neutral for equities). The accelerating growth narrative (GDPNow 3.1%) is a mild negative per the scoring methodology, as it reduces the probability of near-term Fed cuts. Credit spreads (HY OAS 2.88) are flat. Conflicting signals between tech strength and value/small-cap weakness suggest selective positioning. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTREMES (6/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** NQ scores +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH, 7/10 confidence). The session closed at 25,012.62 (+0.87%). The SOX semiconductor index closed at 8,260.42 (+1.07%), near its all-time high of 8,400.02 (Feb 12, 2026), providing strong sector leadership. The MOVE index fell -5.53% to 64.27, signaling reduced rate volatility and a supportive environment for duration-sensitive tech. Real yields flat and USD weak are additional positives. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** YM scores -2 (SLIGHT_BEARISH, 6/10 confidence). The session closed at 49,625.98 (+0.47%), but the macro backdrop is less supportive for value-oriented large caps. The accelerating GDPNow (3.1%) carries a 2x weight for YM, reflecting that above-trend growth reduces the probability of Fed accommodation. The flattening yield curve (2s10s: 0.60, down from 0.74 two weeks ago) is an additional headwind for financials and cyclicals. USD weakness provides the only positive offset. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLY (6/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** RTY scores -2 (SLIGHT_BEARISH, 5/10 confidence). The Russell closed at 2,663.78 (-0.05%), the only major index in the red today. Small caps face the most challenging macro environment: accelerating growth (double-weighted) reduces Fed cut expectations, the flattening yield curve pressures net interest margins for small-cap financials, and credit spreads (HY OAS 2.88) are flat rather than narrowing. The lower confidence (5/10) reflects conflicting signals — the RUT is down on the day despite a broadly positive session, which itself is a bearish signal. Recommended approach: FADE_RALLY (5/10).

**M6E (Euro FX):** M6E scores +3 (BULLISH, 7/10 confidence). EUR/USD is trading above 1.1750, driven by the ECB-Fed policy divergence. The ECB held rates at 2.15% on February 5 (5th consecutive pause) while the market prices ~50bps of Fed cuts in 2026, meaning the rate differential is widening in EUR's favor (double-weighted). USD weakness (DXY -8.71% year-over-year) amplifies the move. Eurozone growth is stable with inflation near the 2% target. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** 6A scores +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH, 6/10 confidence). The RBA surprised markets on February 3 with a 25bp hike to 3.85%, citing materially higher inflation in H2 2025, and has signaled further hikes are possible. AUD rates now exceed USD rates (3.85% vs. 3.50-3.75%), widening the rate differential. USD weakness and rising copper (+15.66% over 3 months) provide additional support. The key headwind is China's slowing growth (official manufacturing PMI 49.3, below 50, double-weighted for 6A), which historically weighs on the commodity-linked AUD. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTREMES (6/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** 6J scores +5 (STRONG_BULLISH, 7/10 confidence). This is the highest-conviction call in the report. The BoJ is in an active tightening cycle (current rate 0.75%), with a majority of economists expecting a hike to 1% by end-June 2026 and markets pricing further hikes through 2027. The JPY-USD rate differential is narrowing from both sides (BoJ hiking, Fed expected to cut ~50bps), and this factor carries a 2x weight. USD weakness provides an additional tailwind. Note: 6J is quoted inversely — bullish 6J = stronger JPY = lower USD/JPY. Japan's January core inflation fell below the BoJ's 2% target, which slightly complicates the timing of the next hike, but the structural tightening narrative remains intact. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

## Key Macro Themes

1. **USD Structural Weakness:** The DXY is down -8.71% year-over-year and -0.83% on the month. The market is pricing ~50bps of Fed cuts in 2026 while the ECB holds and the RBA and BoJ are tightening, creating a multi-directional headwind for the dollar. This is the single most pervasive driver across all 10 instruments.

2. **Commodity Supply Shock (Oil):** The EIA's -9.0M barrel crude draw (steepest since September) combined with US-Iran geopolitical risk has created a sharp bullish catalyst for CL. This is a time-sensitive signal — the inventory draw is one week's data and geopolitical risk can de-escalate quickly.

3. **Equity Bifurcation:** US equity markets are splitting between tech/growth (NQ, ES: slight-bullish) and value/small-cap (YM, RTY: slight-bearish). The accelerating GDPNow (3.1%) and flattening yield curve are creating divergent conditions across the index complex.

## Watch List

- **FOMC Meeting (March 18-19, 2026):** CME FedWatch shows 95.9% probability of no change. Any shift in language toward a more hawkish tone would be bearish for GC, SI, M6E, 6J and bullish for DXY.
- **Iran Response to US Strikes:** Oil markets are in a wait-and-see mode. An escalation would be strongly bullish for CL; a de-escalation would remove the geopolitical risk premium.
- **BoJ Next Meeting (March 2026):** Markets are watching for any signal on the timing of the next hike. A hawkish statement would amplify the 6J STRONG_BULLISH signal.
- **China NPC (March 2026):** China's National People's Congress will set official 2026 growth targets (expected 4.5-5%). Any downside surprise would be bearish for 6A and copper.
- **US CPI (Next Release ~March 11, 2026):** A hot print would reduce Fed cut expectations and pressure GC, M6E, 6J.
