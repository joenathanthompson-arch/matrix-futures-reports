# Executive Summary - February 24, 2026 | 19:33 EST

## Data Quality Notes

All primary data sources were accessible and current as of this report generation. FRED DFII10 (real yields) and BAMLH0A0HYM2 (HY OAS) reflect data through February 23, 2026 — one business day lag, which is within normal FRED reporting cadence and does not require fallback sourcing. All other sources (CME FedWatch, Atlanta Fed GDPNow, CBOE VIX, TradingView DXY/MOVE/SOX, Investing.com Copper, EIA Weekly) reflect current or same-day data. No fallbacks were required.

## Asset Class Overview

- **Commodities:** BULLISH — All three commodity instruments score bullish or better, driven by falling real yields, a large EIA crude draw of 9 million barrels, rising copper prices, and continued gold ETF inflows. Geopolitical risk (US-Iran tensions) provides additional tailwind.
- **Indices:** STRONG_BULLISH — All four equity index instruments score bullish or better. The combination of falling real yields, tight credit spreads (HY OAS 2.95%), a falling VIX (-6.95% today), and rising semiconductor stocks creates a strongly supportive macro backdrop.
- **FX:** BULLISH — Two of three FX instruments score bullish (6A and 6J), with M6E neutral due to EUR-USD rate differential headwinds. RBA's surprise February rate hike supports AUD, while BoJ's hawkish tightening trajectory supports JPY.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a strong bullish bias (+6, STRONG_BULLISH), driven primarily by falling 10-year real yields (DFII10 at 1.77% and declining), which reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. Continued GLD ETF inflows of $276M last week and elevated geopolitical risk from US-Iran tensions and tariff uncertainty provide additional support. The Fed's neutral hold stance removes a key headwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or TREND_CONTINUATION (8/10 confidence).

**SI (Silver):** Silver scores bullish (+4, BULLISH), benefiting from the same falling real yield environment that supports gold, while also receiving a boost from copper's strong uptrend (+17.77% in 3 months), which signals healthy industrial demand. Silver's hybrid precious/industrial nature means it captures both the safe-haven bid and the reflation trade. The main risk is that silver can whipsaw on regime changes between risk-on and risk-off. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT with reduced size given silver's higher volatility (7/10 confidence).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude scores bullish (+4, BULLISH), supported by the largest EIA inventory draw in five months (-9.014 million barrels for the week ending February 13), elevated geopolitical risk from US-Iran tensions, and a neutral-to-flat USD. The GDPNow estimate of 3.1% for Q1 2026 suggests stable demand. A key caveat is that API preliminary data for the following week shows a large build of 11.4 million barrels, which creates near-term uncertainty. Traders should monitor the next EIA release (February 25) closely. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTREMES or wait for EIA confirmation (6/10 confidence).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 scores strong bullish (+6, STRONG_BULLISH), with falling real yields (double-weighted at +4 contribution) as the dominant driver. Tight credit spreads (HY OAS 2.95%, historically low) confirm healthy corporate credit conditions, while the VIX falling 6.95% to 19.55 signals improving risk appetite. The Fed's neutral hold removes policy uncertainty. With GDPNow at 3.1%, the soft-landing narrative remains intact. Recommended approach: TREND_CONTINUATION or IB_BREAKOUT (8/10 confidence).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** Nasdaq 100 scores strong bullish (+6, STRONG_BULLISH), benefiting most from the falling real yield environment given its high duration sensitivity. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) rose 1.45% today and is up 14.32% year-to-date, confirming tech sector strength. The MOVE index fell 4.07% today, reducing rate volatility that had been a headwind. AMD surged 8.77% today on strong earnings, providing additional sector momentum. Recommended approach: TREND_CONTINUATION with half-size on first entry given NQ's higher beta (8/10 confidence).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones scores bullish (+4, BULLISH), supported by falling real yields, tight credit spreads, and a steepening yield curve (2s10s at 0.61%). The steepening curve is particularly positive for Dow components with heavy financial and industrial exposure. Growth narrative is stable at 3.1% GDPNow, supporting the value/cyclical tilt of the Dow. YM is the lower-beta alternative when NQ appears extended. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or TREND_CONTINUATION (7/10 confidence).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Russell 2000 scores strong bullish (+5, STRONG_BULLISH), with credit spreads (double-weighted) as the primary driver. HY OAS at 2.95% is near historically tight levels, which is the single most important factor for small-cap performance given their reliance on high-yield financing. The steepening yield curve also benefits regional banks that are core Russell holdings. Falling real yields and a stable growth environment complete the bullish picture. Recommended approach: TREND_CONTINUATION (7/10 confidence).

**M6E (Micro Euro FX):** The Euro scores neutral (-1, NEUTRAL), caught between two offsetting forces. The EUR-USD rate differential (double-weighted, -2 contribution) remains a headwind as the ECB has cut rates more aggressively than the Fed over the past year, leaving the ECB deposit rate below the Fed funds rate. However, improving Eurozone economic data — the February composite PMI rose to 51.9 (14-month high) with manufacturing PMI hitting a 44-month high of 50.8 — provides a partial offset. The ECB held rates for the fifth consecutive time at its February 5 meeting, suggesting the cutting cycle may be pausing. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE or AVOID until rate differential dynamics shift (6/10 confidence).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar scores bullish (+3, BULLISH), primarily driven by the RBA's surprise 25-basis-point rate hike in February 2026, bringing the cash rate to 3.85% — now above the Fed funds rate. This rate differential widening is positive for AUD/USD. Copper's strong uptrend (+17.77% in 3 months) provides commodity-linked support. China's growth is stable at 4.5% projected for 2026, but the PMI barely above 50 limits the upside from China demand. Risk sentiment is neutral (VIX 19.55). Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on bullish setups (6/10 confidence).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen scores bullish (+4, BULLISH), driven by the BoJ's hawkish tightening trajectory (double-weighted, +2 contribution) and the narrowing JPY-USD rate differential as the BoJ hikes while the Fed holds (double-weighted, +2 contribution). Reuters reported on February 23 that the BoJ may raise rates as soon as March if the yen resumes its slide. A key risk is that Japan's Prime Minister Takaichi reportedly questioned further rate hike plans, creating political uncertainty around BoJ policy. Recall that 6J is quoted inversely — bullish 6J means USD/JPY falls (yen strengthens). Recommended approach: FADE_RALLIES in USD/JPY or IB_BREAKOUT on 6J bullish setups (6/10 confidence).

## Key Macro Themes

The dominant macro theme is the combination of falling real yields and tight financial conditions, which creates a broadly supportive environment for risk assets. The 10-year TIPS yield at 1.77% and declining, combined with HY credit spreads at historically tight levels (2.95%), suggests the market is pricing a soft landing with continued Fed accommodation. The VIX falling sharply today (-6.95%) and the MOVE index declining (-4.07%) confirm that both equity and rate volatility are compressing, which typically precedes further risk asset appreciation.

The second theme is commodity tightness driven by supply disruptions and geopolitical risk. The EIA's record crude draw of 9 million barrels, combined with US-Iran tensions and tariff uncertainty, supports energy prices. Copper's 17.77% three-month rally signals strong industrial demand expectations, which also supports silver's industrial component.

The third theme is FX divergence driven by central bank policy divergence. The RBA's surprise hike supports AUD, the BoJ's tightening trajectory supports JPY, while the ECB's rate differential disadvantage keeps EUR neutral. The USD (DXY at 97.88) is flat on the day but down 8.21% over the past year, providing a structural tailwind for commodity-denominated assets and non-USD currencies.

## Watch List

The next EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report releases on **February 25, 2026** — the API's preliminary 11.4 million barrel build for the week ending February 20 could significantly alter the CL bias if confirmed. The next FOMC meeting is on **March 19, 2026** (21 days away), with 97.4% probability of no change. The BoJ's March meeting is a key event for 6J, with Reuters reporting a potential March rate hike if the yen weakens. China's National People's Congress begins in early March and will set the 2026 GDP growth target, which is critical for 6A and commodity demand expectations.
