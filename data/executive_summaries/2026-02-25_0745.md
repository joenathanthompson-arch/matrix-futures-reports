## Data Quality Notes

DFII10 (10Y real yields) and BAMLH0A0HYM2 (HY OAS) are 2 days stale due to weekend lag; direction confirmed via chart trend analysis. Gold ETF flows not directly verified from WGC — inferred from gold trading at all-time highs (~$5,100/oz). EIA inventory data from the Feb 19, 2026 weekly report (most recent available). Confidence reduced by 1 point for GC and SI due to ETF flow assumption. MOVE index 1-month trend (+15.51%) used as primary signal for rate volatility direction.

## News Summary

### Futures
Wall Street bounced back strongly on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 closing at 6,890 (+0.77%), the Nasdaq 100 at 24,977 (+1.09%), the Dow at 49,174 (+0.76%), and the Russell 2000 at 2,652 (+1.20%). The rally was driven by renewed AI enthusiasm ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, which offset lingering tariff concerns. US futures are flat in overnight trading after President Trump's State of the Union speech, with Asian markets mostly higher tracking the Wall Street rally. WTI crude ticked up ~0.7% to ~$66.08, and gold edged higher near $5,100/oz on possible position adjustments.

### Currencies
The Australian dollar firmed after Australia's Trimmed Mean CPI came in at 0.3% (below the 0.4% forecast but still elevated), keeping the RBA on a tightening track following its February 3 rate hike to 3.85%. AUD/USD rose approximately 0.25%. USD/JPY rose nearly 1% as the yen weakened following Japan's Prime Minister Takaichi's comments pushing back against further BoJ rate hikes, creating uncertainty around the BoJ's hiking path. The DXY remains weak at 97.70 (-0.19% today, -0.55% YTD), supporting EUR/USD near $1.18.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold) — Score: +6 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10**
Gold scores a strong bullish bias (+6), driven primarily by falling 10-year real yields (DFII10 at 1.77%, down from ~2.0% in January, contributing +4 weighted points) and a weakening DXY (97.70, -0.55% YTD). Gold is trading near all-time highs of approximately $5,100/oz, supported by persistent safe-haven demand amid tariff uncertainty and geopolitical risk from Iran. The hawkish Fed stance (-1) is the only meaningful headwind, but it is overwhelmed by the yield and USD tailwinds. ETF inflows are inferred from price action rather than directly verified from WGC data, reducing confidence slightly. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT or FADE_EXTENSION on pullbacks to prior ATH levels (7/10).

**SI (Silver) — Score: +4 | BULLISH | Confidence: 6/10**
Silver shows a solid bullish bias (+4), benefiting from the same falling real yield environment as gold (+2), a weak DXY (+1), rising copper (+1), and positive gold ETF flow inference (+1). The hawkish Fed stance (-1) is the primary drag. Silver's hybrid precious/industrial nature means it also benefits from the copper rally (+33% YTD), reflecting strong industrial demand and reflation expectations. The score is one notch below gold due to silver's higher beta and the absence of direct ETF flow confirmation. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW long on dips toward the 20-day MA (6/10).

**CL (WTI Crude) — Score: +5 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10**
Crude oil earns a strong bullish score (+5), with the primary drivers being a tightening supply environment (EIA weekly showing crude inventories below the 5-year seasonal average, contributing +2 weighted) and a significant inventory draw of approximately 9.0 million barrels in the most recent EIA report (+1). Rising geopolitical risk from ongoing Iran-related tensions and US military activity (+1) and a weak DXY (+1) complete the picture. Growth is scored neutral (GDPNow at 3.1% = stable), preventing an even higher score. Today's EIA weekly report (10:30am ET) is a key catalyst — a further draw would confirm the bullish thesis. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long, with the EIA report as the key intraday trigger (7/10).

**ES (S&P 500) — Score: +6 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence: 8/10**
The S&P 500 futures show the strongest conviction bullish signal among the indices (+6), driven by falling real yields (double-weighted at +4), a weak DXY (+1), narrowing HY credit spreads at 2.95% OAS (+1), and a falling VIX (+1). The hawkish Fed hold (-1) is the sole headwind. The macro environment — tight credit, falling rate volatility, and AI-driven earnings optimism — is highly supportive of equity risk. The 2s10s yield curve at +0.61% (steepening) further supports the soft-landing narrative. Signal decay is moderate: this bias is valid for 3-5 sessions unless a hawkish Fed surprise or credit event occurs. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long, fade VIX spikes (8/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100) — Score: +4 | BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10**
Nasdaq 100 futures are bullish (+4), with falling real yields providing the dominant +4 weighted contribution, partially offset by the hawkish Fed (-1) and rising MOVE index (-1). The SOX semiconductor index is up +1.45% today and +14.32% YTD, reflecting strong AI/tech demand momentum (+1). The rising MOVE index (up +15.51% over the past month) is the key risk — elevated rate volatility can compress tech multiples rapidly. NQ is the highest-beta instrument and should be sized at half on first entry per methodology. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long, but reduce size vs ES given MOVE headwind (7/10).

**YM (Dow Jones) — Score: +4 | BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10**
The Dow Jones futures are bullish (+4), supported by falling real yields (+2), a weak DXY (+1), narrowing credit spreads (+1), and a steepening yield curve (+1). The hawkish Fed stance (-1) is the drag. YM is the lower-beta alternative to NQ when rate volatility is elevated — the steepening 2s10s curve (+0.61%) particularly benefits the value/cyclical composition of the Dow. Growth is scored neutral (GDPNow 3.1% = stable), meaning no additional tailwind from the double-weighted growth factor. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW long, preferred vehicle when NQ is volatile (7/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000) — Score: +5 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence: 7/10**
The Russell 2000 scores strongly bullish (+5), with the double-weighted credit spread factor (+2) being the key differentiator versus other indices. HY OAS at 2.95% (near cycle lows) is highly supportive of small-cap financing conditions. Falling real yields (+2), weak DXY (+1), and a steepening curve (+1) add further support, while the hawkish Fed (-1) is the only drag. Small caps are the most credit-sensitive instrument in the suite, and the current tight spread environment is the ideal backdrop. The 2s10s steepening (+0.61%) also benefits RTY as it signals improved bank lending margins. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long, highest conviction among indices given credit tailwind (7/10).

**M6E (Micro Euro FX) — Score: -2 | SLIGHT_BEARISH | Confidence: 6/10**
The Euro futures show a slight bearish bias (-2), driven by the double-weighted rate differential factor (-2). Despite the DXY being weak (+1), the EUR-USD rate differential remains significantly negative — the Fed funds rate (~4.25-4.50%) is approximately 225-250 basis points above the ECB deposit rate (2.00%), creating a structural headwind for EUR/USD. The ECB is on neutral hold (0), and Eurozone growth is stable (German GDP confirmed at 0.3%, GfK Consumer Climate at -24.7, worse than expected). The weak DXY is partially offsetting the differential headwind, which explains why EUR/USD is near $1.18 despite the spread. This is a conflicted signal — the score reflects the structural rate differential drag, but the DXY trend is supportive. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTENSION on EUR/USD rallies toward resistance; avoid aggressive shorts given DXY weakness (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar) — Score: +5 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence: 6/10**
The Australian dollar futures are strongly bullish (+5), supported by the RBA's hawkish stance following its February 3 rate hike to 3.85% (+1), a widening AUD-USD rate differential (+1), a weak DXY (+1), rising copper (+1), and a risk-on environment (double-weighted at +2). The hawkish Fed (-1) is the only drag. Today's Australian CPI data (Trimmed Mean 0.3%, below 0.4% forecast) keeps the RBA on a tightening path, as inflation remains above target. China growth is scored neutral (NBS PMI 49.3 contraction vs Caixin 50.3 expansion = mixed). The confidence is slightly lower (6/10) due to China growth uncertainty and the fact that AUD/USD has already rallied ~0.25% today. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW long on pullbacks; watch RBA Gov Bullock's speech (9:40am ET) for guidance (6/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen) — Score: +4 | BULLISH | Confidence: 6/10**
Japanese yen futures are bullish (+4), driven by the double-weighted BoJ stance (+2) and double-weighted narrowing JPY-USD rate differential (+2), partially offset by the hawkish Fed (-1). The BoJ is in an active hiking cycle, with the policy rate at ~0.5%, and the narrowing differential between Japanese and US rates is the structural driver of yen strength. However, a key risk emerged overnight: Japan's Prime Minister Takaichi made comments pushing back against further BoJ rate hikes, causing USD/JPY to rise nearly 1% and weakening the yen. This political uncertainty is a significant caveat — if the PM's comments delay the next BoJ hike, the bullish 6J thesis could be challenged. The DXY weakness (+1) provides additional support. Note: 6J is quoted inversely — bullish 6J means lower USD/JPY. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW long 6J (short USD/JPY) on pullbacks, but reduce size given PM pushback risk (6/10).

## Key Macro Themes

1. **Falling real yields are the dominant bullish driver** across GC, ES, NQ, and RTY. The 10-year TIPS yield (DFII10) has declined from ~2.0% in January to 1.77% as of February 23, reflecting a softening in the real rate environment despite the Fed's hawkish hold. This is the single most important factor in today's report.

2. **USD weakness is a broad tailwind** for commodities, risk assets, and commodity currencies. The DXY is down -0.55% YTD and -8.49% over the past year, creating a favorable macro backdrop for GC, CL, SI, 6A, and 6J simultaneously.

3. **Credit conditions are benign** (HY OAS 2.95%, near cycle lows; 2s10s curve +0.61% steepening), supporting the soft-landing narrative and particularly benefiting RTY and ES. The steepening yield curve is a positive signal for bank lending and small-cap financing.
