## Data Quality Notes

All primary data sources were accessed and verified as of February 20, 2026. Real yields (DFII10 at 1.79%) and HY OAS (2.88%) reflect February 19 FRED data — one business day lag, which is within the acceptable staleness protocol. The 2s10s yield curve (0.60) and GDPNow (3.1%) are current as of today. The EIA weekly petroleum report covers the week ending February 13 (released February 19) — also within acceptable lag. China PMI data uses the January 2026 NBS official reading (49.3) and the February 2026 Caixin flash estimate (48.0). No stale sources required confidence reduction.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold): 0 NEUTRAL (7/10)**
**Approach:** RANGE_TRADE | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session

Gold sits at a macro crossroads today. The hawkish Fed hold (-1) and accelerating US growth narrative (-1, GDPNow 3.1%) are meaningful headwinds, as higher-for-longer rates erode the opportunity cost advantage of holding non-yielding gold. However, these are precisely offset by robust gold ETF inflows (+1, global AUM at a record $669bn), tightening oil supply (+1), and flat real yields (0, DFII10 at 1.79%, within ±5bps). The net score of zero reflects genuine two-sided risk. With the VIX in the balanced zone (19.09) and DXY essentially flat, there is no dominant directional catalyst today. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE within the current session, with no swing bias.

**SI (Silver): 0 NEUTRAL (6/10)**
**Approach:** RANGE_TRADE | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session

Silver's hybrid nature as both a precious and industrial metal creates a balanced but uncertain picture. The hawkish Fed (-1) and accelerating growth narrative (-1) are headwinds on the precious side, while rising copper (+1, up 2.29% to $5.87/lb) and gold ETF inflows (+1) provide industrial and precious metal tailwinds respectively. Real yields flat and DXY flat add no directional push. The net zero score reflects the tug-of-war between silver's two identities. Confidence is moderate at 6/10 given the mixed signal environment. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE intraday; avoid directional swing positions.

**CL (Crude Oil): +2 SLIGHT_BULLISH (7/10)**
**Approach:** IB_BREAKOUT | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session

Crude oil carries the day's most constructive commodity setup. The EIA weekly report (week ending Feb 13) showed a massive draw of 9.0 million barrels, with total commercial petroleum inventories falling 19.1 million barrels — inventories now sit approximately 5% below the five-year seasonal average, signaling tight supply. Oil supply scores +2 (2x weight) and inventories score +1. Geopolitical risk (+1) from ongoing Middle East tensions and the approaching US-Iran nuclear deal deadline (~March 6-7) adds a risk premium. The only meaningful offset is the accelerating US growth narrative (-2, 2x weight), which in the CL model is bearish because strong growth can paradoxically signal demand-pull inflation concerns and Fed tightening. WTI spot was $63.05 as of February 13. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on the long side during the session.

**ES (S&P 500): -1 NEUTRAL (6/10)**
**Approach:** RANGE_TRADE | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session

The S&P 500 closed up 0.69% today at 6,909.51, driven by a Supreme Court ruling providing partial tariff relief. However, the macro scoring model reflects a more cautious picture. The hawkish Fed (-1) and accelerating growth narrative (-1, which in the ES model signals that the Fed will remain restrictive) are the primary headwinds. These are partially offset by the falling VIX (+1, down 5.64% to 19.09), while real yields (flat, 0), DXY (flat, 0), and credit spreads (flat, HY OAS 2.88%, 0) contribute no directional signal. The net score of -1 lands squarely in the NEUTRAL band. Q4 earnings are strong (+12.7% YoY, 75.9% beat rate), but this is a backward-looking factor not captured in the macro model. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE; the intraday rally may fade without a fresh macro catalyst.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100): 0 NEUTRAL (6/10)**
**Approach:** RANGE_TRADE | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session

The Nasdaq model is balanced between its rate-sensitive bullish drivers and the hawkish macro backdrop. Rising SOX (+1, Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 1.07% to 8,260, within 1.7% of its all-time high of 8,400) and falling MOVE (+1, down 5.53% to 64.27, signaling reduced rate volatility) provide genuine bullish support. However, the hawkish Fed (-1) and accelerating growth narrative (-1) offset these gains. Real yields are flat (0, DFII10 1.79%), which is the most important factor for NQ (2x weight) — neither helping nor hurting. The net zero score reflects a market that wants to go higher on tech momentum but is constrained by the macro ceiling. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE; wait for a real yield catalyst before committing to a swing position.

**YM (Dow Jones): -4 BEARISH (6/10)**
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW (short bias) | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 1-2 days

The Dow Jones faces the most challenging macro setup among the equity indices. The flattening yield curve (-1, 2s10s fell from 0.74 to 0.60, a 14-basis-point decline this week) is a direct headwind for the value and financial stocks that dominate the Dow. The accelerating growth narrative carries double weight (-2) in the YM model because strong growth signals the Fed will remain hawkish for longer, which compresses the valuation multiples of the Dow's cyclical and financial components. The hawkish Fed hold adds another -1. Credit spreads and real yields are flat (0 each), providing no offset. The -4 BEARISH score reflects a structural macro headwind, even as today's price action was positive (+0.47%). Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with a short bias on swing timeframe; consider fading intraday rallies.

**RTY (Russell 2000): -4 BEARISH (6/10)**
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW (short bias) | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 1-2 days

The Russell 2000 shares the Dow's bearish macro score but for slightly different reasons. Small caps are the most credit-sensitive segment of the equity market, relying heavily on bank lending and high-yield financing. While credit spreads are currently flat (HY OAS 2.88%, 0 contribution even with 2x weight), the combination of a hawkish Fed (-1), accelerating growth narrative (-2, 2x weight), and flattening yield curve (-1) creates a hostile environment for small-cap borrowers. The flattening curve compresses net interest margins for regional banks that are critical lenders to small businesses. Russell 2000 was essentially flat today (-0.05%), underperforming large-cap indices — consistent with the bearish macro signal. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with a short bias; monitor HY OAS closely, as any widening would accelerate the bearish thesis.

**M6E (Micro Euro FX): 0 NEUTRAL (6/10)**
**Approach:** RANGE_TRADE | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session

EUR/USD sits in a macro equilibrium today. The hawkish Fed hold (-1) is the primary headwind, but it is offset by accelerating Eurozone growth (+1, HCOB Flash Composite PMI rose to 51.9 in February from 51.3, a 14-month high, with manufacturing hitting a 44-month high of 50.8). The ECB is in a neutral hold at 2.00% (0), and the rate differential between the Fed (3.625%) and ECB (2.00%) is stable with both on hold (0, 2x weight). DXY is flat (0) and VIX is in the balanced zone (0). The divergence between US PMI slowing (52.3, 10-month low) and Eurozone PMI accelerating is a notable fundamental tailwind for EUR that is partially captured in the growth factor. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE; the EUR/USD is caught between a hawkish Fed and improving Eurozone fundamentals.

**6A (Australian Dollar): +2 SLIGHT_BULLISH (6/10)**
**Approach:** IB_BREAKOUT | **Mode:** INTRADAY | **Hold:** session

The Australian Dollar has a modestly bullish macro setup, driven by the RBA's hawkish reversal. The RBA unanimously hiked rates to 3.85% on February 3, 2026 — the first hike in two years — citing materially higher inflation in the second half of 2025. This hawkish stance (+1) combined with a now-positive rate differential versus the USD (+1, RBA 3.85% vs Fed 3.625%) and risk-on sentiment (+2, 2x weight, VIX falling and equity markets up) provides a solid foundation. Rising copper (+1, up 2.29%) adds commodity currency support. The critical headwind is China growth (-2, 2x weight): the NBS Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.3 in January (below 50 = contraction) and the Caixin February flash estimate dropped to 48.0, a five-month low. China is Australia's largest trade partner, and deteriorating Chinese demand is a significant structural risk. The hawkish Fed (-1) also weighs. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on the long side intraday, but monitor China PMI closely.

**6J (Japanese Yen): +3 BULLISH (7/10)**
**Approach:** TREND_FOLLOW | **Mode:** SWING | **Hold:** 1-2 days

The Japanese Yen is the highest-conviction bullish signal in today's report. The BoJ's hawkish tilt carries double weight (+2, 2x weight): the central bank held at 0.75% in January but upgraded growth and inflation forecasts, with multiple board members signaling a rate hike as early as April 2026. Oxford Economics raised their terminal rate assumption to 1.5%, and the IMF projects the BoJ policy rate reaching 1.2% by end-2026. The narrowing rate differential (+2, 2x weight) — as the BoJ hikes while the Fed holds — is the structural driver of JPY strength. The hawkish Fed (-1) is the only offset, as it supports USD broadly. DXY flat (0) and VIX balanced (0) add no directional noise. Note that 6J is quoted inversely: a bullish 6J score means JPY strengthening and USD/JPY falling. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on the long side (long JPY, short USD/JPY); this is a multi-session swing trade thesis.

## Key Macro Themes

**1. US-Eurozone Growth Divergence Favoring EUR and JPY:** Today's flash PMI data revealed a striking divergence — the US Composite PMI fell to a 10-month low of 52.3 (manufacturing at 51.2, a 7-month low), while the Eurozone Composite PMI rose to a 14-month high of 51.9 (manufacturing at a 44-month high of 50.8). The US has slipped below the G4 average in output growth for the first time since April 2024. This divergence supports EUR fundamentals and, combined with the BoJ's hawkish trajectory, reinforces the FX BULLISH bias.

**2. Yield Curve Flattening Pressures Small Caps and Value Stocks:** The 2s10s yield curve has flattened 14 basis points this week (from 0.74 to 0.60), creating a headwind for the Dow Jones and Russell 2000. The flattening reflects the market pricing in a Fed that will remain restrictive (hawkish hold) while longer-term growth expectations moderate. This is the primary driver of the BEARISH signals for YM and RTY, and it stands in contrast to the positive price action seen today following the Supreme Court tariff ruling.

**3. BoJ Normalization Cycle Accelerating:** Multiple signals confirm the BoJ's hawkish pivot is deepening. An April 2026 rate hike is now the market consensus, with a terminal rate of 1.5% expected. Japan's core inflation fell to a 2-year low in January, which could complicate timing, but the structural wage-price dynamic remains intact. The narrowing US-Japan rate differential is the most powerful structural driver in the FX space, making 6J the highest-conviction trade in today's report.
