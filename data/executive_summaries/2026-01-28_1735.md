## Data Quality Notes

All data sources are current and fresh. No stale sources or fallbacks required. Fed stance updated with latest FedWatch probabilities showing dovish tilt (13.5% cut probability at next meeting).

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities:** BULLISH - Precious metals supported by dovish Fed and weak USD, with strong ETF inflows. Crude oil mixed due to inventory builds offsetting geopolitical tensions.

**Indices:** BULLISH - All four equity indices showing bullish bias, supported by narrowing credit spreads, falling volatility, and dovish Fed stance. Tech sector particularly strong with SOX up 2.4%.

**FX:** BULLISH - Strong bullish bias across all three major FX pairs, driven by central bank divergence. RBA expected to hike, BoJ continuing tightening cycle, while Fed remains dovish.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by dovish Fed stance and weak USD. Real yields remain flat, limiting upside momentum, but strong ETF inflows ($1.7B into GLD last week) continue to provide support. The 13.5% probability of a Fed cut at the next meeting is keeping gold bid. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on weakness (7/10 confidence).

**SI (Silver):** Silver displays a bullish bias (+3), benefiting from both its precious metal characteristics and industrial demand. Copper strength (+0.9% today, +40% YoY) signals healthy industrial demand, while gold ETF inflows provide precious metal support. The dual nature of silver makes it attractive in the current environment. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with copper confirmation (7/10 confidence).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil shows a slight bullish bias (+1) with conflicting signals. Geopolitical tensions (Iran threats, Middle East armada) support prices, but inventory builds (-3.6M barrels) and strong growth (GDPNow 5.4%) creating mixed picture. Weak USD provides modest support. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE until geopolitical situation clarifies (6/10 confidence).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 shows a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by narrowing credit spreads and dovish Fed stance. Strong economic growth (GDPNow 5.4%) is a double-edged sword, supporting earnings but potentially limiting Fed dovishness. VIX remains balanced at 16.5. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT on credit spread confirmation (7/10 confidence).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** Nasdaq displays a bullish bias (+3), the strongest among equity indices. Semiconductor strength (SOX +2.4% today, +62% YoY) is a powerful tailwind, while falling rate volatility (MOVE -5.6% monthly) supports duration-sensitive tech. Dovish Fed and flat real yields create favorable conditions. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with SOX leadership (8/10 confidence).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow shows a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by yield curve steepening (2s10s at 0.71%, up from 0.5%) which favors cyclicals and financials. Credit spreads narrowing to 2.69% support the old-economy names in the Dow. Strong growth is positive for industrial components. Recommended approach: ROTATION_PLAY from tech to cyclicals (7/10 confidence).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Small caps show a bullish bias (+3), driven primarily by narrowing credit spreads (weighted 2x in methodology). At 2.69%, HY spreads are near cycle lows, critical for leveraged small caps. Yield curve steepening and dovish Fed also supportive. Strong growth helps offset higher borrowing costs. Recommended approach: CREDIT_SPREAD_PLAY with tight stops (7/10 confidence).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro shows a slight bullish bias (+2), driven primarily by USD weakness. Rate differentials remain neutral as both Fed and ECB are on hold, though ECB has dovish tilt (concerned about strong EUR). The 13.5% Fed cut probability is the main driver. Recommended approach: USD_WEAKNESS_PLAY rather than EUR strength (6/10 confidence).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Aussie dollar shows a strong bullish bias (+5), the highest conviction FX trade. RBA is expected to hike to 3.85% at the February 3 meeting (first hike since November 2023) due to CPI at 3.8%. This creates widening rate differential vs dovish Fed. Copper strength (+40% YoY) and weak USD provide additional support. Recommended approach: RATE_DIFFERENTIAL_PLAY ahead of RBA meeting (8/10 confidence).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Yen shows a strong bullish bias (+6), the highest score across all instruments. BoJ held at 0.75% but minutes suggest further hikes coming (possibly to 1% by July). Rate differential narrowing as BoJ tightens while Fed stays dovish. Remember 6J is inverted: bullish 6J = bullish JPY = bearish USD/JPY. Recommended approach: CARRY_UNWIND_PLAY with strong conviction (8/10 confidence).

## Key Macro Themes

**Central Bank Divergence:** The dominant theme is policy divergence. Fed showing dovish tilt (13.5% cut probability), while RBA preparing to hike and BoJ continuing normalization. This creates powerful rate differential trades, particularly in FX markets.

**Credit Market Calm:** HY spreads at 2.69% (near cycle lows) and falling rate volatility (MOVE -31% over 6 months) signal healthy credit conditions. This is particularly bullish for leveraged sectors like small caps and supportive of risk assets broadly.

**USD Weakness Regime:** DXY down 2.24% over 5 days and 1.96% over 1 month. This broad-based USD weakness is lifting all asset classes - commodities, equities, and FX. The dovish Fed stance is the primary driver of this weakness.

## Watch List

**February 3, 2026:** RBA meeting - Market pricing in rate hike to 3.85%. High conviction event for 6A positioning.

**February 5, 2026:** ECB meeting - Watch for dovish rhetoric about strong EUR, potential signal for future cuts.

**March 18, 2026:** Next FOMC meeting - Currently 82.7% hold probability, 16.7% cut probability. Any shift in Fed rhetoric will impact all asset classes.

**Weekly EIA Report:** Next Wednesday - Watch for inventory draws to support crude oil given geopolitical tensions.

**Geopolitical Developments:** Iran tensions and Middle East situation remain fluid. Any escalation would support gold and crude oil significantly.
