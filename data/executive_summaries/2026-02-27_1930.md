## Executive Summary

This 19:30 EST post-market report incorporates the full session close data and revises scores from the 17:30 report. The dominant late-session development was the **January PPI print significantly exceeding expectations** (Core PPI +0.8% MoM vs. +0.3% forecast; headline +0.5% vs. +0.3% forecast), which drove a broad equity selloff into the close. The S&P 500 finished -0.43% at 6,878.88 and the Nasdaq Composite lost -0.92% to 22,668.21. This hot inflation print reduces near-term Fed cut expectations and has been incorporated into the equity scores.

The dominant macro theme remains the **precious metals bull run**: gold posted its best calendar month in over a decade in February, adding approximately +$516/oz (+11%) to close near $5,246. The primary driver is the compression in real yields — DFII10 fell to 1.74% as of February 26, down from approximately 1.90% two weeks ago, as the bond market rallied strongly with the 10-year nominal yield breaking below 4.00% intraday. Gold ETF inflows have reached $18B+ year-to-date, with GLD holdings at their highest level since April 2022. Silver futures surged +6.3% today to $93.30, benefiting from gold momentum and copper's continued strength.

The **crude oil picture is conflicted**: the bearish EIA inventory build of +16.0M barrels (week ending February 20) was the largest in recent history, but US-Iran geopolitical tensions escalated sharply today, with reports of potential US military action against Iran driving WTI crude +2.8% to close at $67.02. This geopolitical risk premium reduces the net bearish score to -1.

The **FX landscape** is bifurcated: the Japanese Yen and Australian Dollar carry the strongest bullish signals, while the Euro faces structural headwinds from the USD rate differential. The BoJ's hawkish pivot continues to drive 6J higher (USD/JPY at 155.79), and the RBA's surprise hike to 3.85% on February 3 has propelled AUD/USD to three-year highs near 0.71.

## Instrument Analysis

**GC (Gold): Score +5 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence 8/10**
Gold is the highest-conviction instrument in today's report. The 10-year TIPS real yield (DFII10) fell to 1.74% as of February 26 — down approximately 16 basis points from two weeks ago — providing the primary structural tailwind (double-weighted, contributing +4 to the total). Gold posted its best monthly gain in over a decade in February (+$516/oz, +11%), closing near $5,246. GLD ETF holdings are at their highest since April 2022, reflecting sustained institutional demand (+1). The US-Iran geopolitical risk spike provides an additional safe-haven premium, and the slowing GDPNow (3.0%) adds a further +1. The hot PPI print is a mild headwind but insufficient to override the real yield compression thesis. Signal decay note: valid 2-5 days; monitor US-Iran resolution and any Fed communication that could reverse real yield compression. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on pullbacks; SWING mode, 2-5 day hold (8/10).

**SI (Silver): Score +5 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence 7/10**
Silver futures surged +6.3% today to $93.30 (March contract), driven by gold momentum and copper's continued strength (copper at $6.0570, +0.87% today). The gold-silver ratio is compressing, and silver's hybrid precious/industrial nature is being supported by both the safe-haven bid and the copper rally. Real yield compression and gold ETF inflows provide the same structural tailwind as gold. Silver's higher beta means it can outperform gold in a precious metals rally but also whipsaw more violently. Signal decay note: valid 1-3 days; monitor gold direction and copper for continuation. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW; SWING mode, 1-3 day hold (7/10).

**CL (WTI Crude): Score -1 | SLIGHT_BEARISH | Confidence 6/10**
The crude oil signal is the most conflicted in today's report. The structural bearish case remains intact: the EIA reported a +16.0M barrel inventory build for the week ending February 20, the largest build in recent history, with US production at 13.702 million bpd near record highs. The double-weighted oil supply shock factor scores -2 and the inventories factor scores -1, for a combined -3 from bearish supply factors. However, US-Iran geopolitical tensions escalated sharply today, with reports of potential US military action against Iran driving WTI +2.8% to close at $67.02 — the highest since August 2025. The double-weighted growth narrative (GDPNow 3.0%, score +2) and geopolitical risk (+1) and USD weakness (+1) collectively offset to produce a net score of -1. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; the OPEC+ meeting on March 4-5 is the next key catalyst. Recommended approach: FADE_RANGE; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**ES (S&P 500): Score +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
The S&P 500 closed -0.43% at 6,878.88 on Friday, finishing February in the red. The hot PPI print (Core +0.8% MoM) is the dominant bearish catalyst for today's session, reducing near-term Fed cut expectations and weighing on risk appetite. The structural macro backdrop — falling real yields (double-weighted, +4), stable growth (GDPNow 3.0%, +1), and USD weakness (+1) — provides a bullish underpinning, but the hot inflation data creates a hawkish Fed signal (-0 net, as Fed stance is neutral hold = 0), while rising VIX direction (-1) and widening credit spreads (-1) create headwinds. Net score: +2. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; the March 19 FOMC meeting is the next key catalyst. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100): Score +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
The Nasdaq Composite closed -0.92% on Friday, underperforming the S&P 500 as technology stocks bore the brunt of the AI-uncertainty and hot inflation selloff. The SOX semiconductor index fell -1.21% to 8,098.37 and is down -2.28% for the month, reflecting ongoing concerns about AI capex sustainability. The MOVE index surge (+14.79% to 73.38) signals elevated rate volatility, which is a structural headwind for high-duration growth stocks (both SOX and MOVE score -1 each). The structural tailwind from falling real yields (double-weighted, +4) and USD weakness (+1) and growth (+1) provides support, netting to +2. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; monitor SOX direction and any AI-related headlines. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**YM (Dow Jones): Score +2 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
The Dow Jones closed down more than 500 points on Friday, driven by the hot PPI print and broad risk-off positioning. However, the Dow's lower-beta composition and exposure to value/cyclical sectors provides relative resilience compared to the Nasdaq. The double-weighted growth narrative (GDPNow 3.0%, score +2) is the primary driver, supported by real yields (+2) and USD weakness (+1). Widening credit spreads (-1) and the flat 2s10s curve (0) are headwinds. Net score: +2. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000): Score +1 | SLIGHT_BULLISH | Confidence 6/10**
The Russell 2000 is the most sensitive index to credit conditions, and the widening HY OAS (2.98%, up from recent lows near 2.70%) is a double-weighted headwind (-2) in the scoring model. The hot PPI print adds further pressure by reducing Fed cut expectations — small-cap companies are disproportionately reliant on floating-rate financing. The double-weighted growth narrative (GDPNow 3.0%, score +2), real yields (+2), and USD weakness (+1) provide offsetting support, resulting in a net score of +1. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; monitor credit spreads and any regional bank headlines. Recommended approach: FADE_RANGE; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**M6E (Micro Euro FX): Score -1 | SLIGHT_BEARISH | Confidence 6/10**
The EUR/USD is trading near 1.1805, consolidating below the 20-day EMA. The primary bearish driver is the rate differential: the Fed holds at 3.50-3.75% while the ECB holds at 2.00%, creating a 150-175 basis point USD advantage. The double-weighted rate differential factor scores -2 (widening vs USD, as USD holds higher while ECB holds lower). The hot US PPI print reinforces the "Fed holds longer" narrative. USD weakness (+1) and balanced risk mood (0) provide partial offsets. Eurozone growth is assessed as stable (Composite PMI 51.9 in February, a 14-month high), scoring 0. Net score: -1. Signal decay note: valid session-to-session; monitor ECB March 19 meeting for any hawkish surprise. Recommended approach: FADE_RANGE on rallies toward 1.183 resistance; INTRADAY mode, session hold (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar): Score +4 | BULLISH | Confidence 7/10**
The Australian Dollar is near three-year highs around 0.71, supported by a widening AU-US 2-year yield spread and broad USD structural weakness. The RBA's surprise hike to 3.85% on February 3 — the first hike in two years — has shifted the rate differential in AUD's favor: RBA 3.85% vs. Fed 3.50-3.75%, giving AUD a slight rate advantage. RBA stance (+1), rate differential widening vs USD (+1), copper strength (+1), and USD weakness (+1) all contribute positively. China's mixed PMI data (official 49.3 contraction, Caixin 50.3 expansion) scores 0 on the double-weighted China growth factor. Risk sentiment is balanced (VIX 15-20), scoring 0 on the double-weighted risk sentiment factor. Net score: +4. Signal decay note: valid 1-2 days; monitor China PMI (March 2) and risk sentiment for continuation. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on dips toward 0.70 support; SWING mode, 1-2 day hold (7/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen): Score +5 | STRONG_BULLISH | Confidence 7/10**
The Japanese Yen carries a high-conviction bullish signal driven by the BoJ's accelerating hawkish pivot. The BoJ is currently at 0.75% with an April hike to 1.00% widely expected. USD/JPY is trading at 155.79, declining on the day as the JPY strengthens. The double-weighted BoJ stance (hawkish/tightening, +2) and double-weighted rate differential (narrowing vs USD as BoJ hikes while Fed holds, +2) are the primary drivers. USD weakness (+1) adds further support. Risk mood is balanced (VIX 15-20), scoring 0. Fed neutral hold scores 0. Net score: +5. Signal decay note: valid 2-5 days; the BoJ April meeting is the primary catalyst; monitor Tokyo CPI for any signals of a pause. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW on USD/JPY pullbacks (selling USD/JPY); SWING mode, 2-5 day hold (7/10).

## Key Macro Themes

**1. Gold's Historic February and Real Yield Compression**
Gold posted its best calendar month in over a decade in February, adding approximately +$516/oz (+11%) to close near $5,246. The primary driver is the compression in 10-year real yields (DFII10 at 1.74%, down from ~1.90% two weeks ago), as the bond market rallied strongly — the 10-year nominal yield broke below 4.00% intraday for the first time since November 2025. This real yield compression, combined with $18B+ in gold ETF inflows year-to-date and rising geopolitical risk, creates a powerful structural tailwind for precious metals.

**2. Stagflation Concern: Hot PPI Meets Strong Chicago PMI**
Today's economic data presents a challenging combination: Core PPI rose +0.8% MoM (more than double the +0.3% forecast), while the Chicago PMI surged to 57.7 (near a 4-year high, well above the 52.8 forecast). This combination — strong activity but persistent upstream inflation — raises stagflation concerns and reduces the probability of near-term Fed rate cuts. CME FedWatch now shows a 96-98% probability of a hold at the March 19 FOMC meeting. This is bearish for equities and supportive of the USD, but the bond market's rally (driven by safe-haven demand) is keeping real yields compressed, which continues to support gold.

**3. US-Iran Geopolitical Risk Spike**
Reports of potential US military action against Iran drove WTI crude oil +2.8% to close at $67.02 today, partially reversing the bearish signal from the +16.0M barrel EIA inventory build. This geopolitical risk premium also supports gold and the Japanese Yen as safe-haven assets. The situation is fluid and represents the primary upside risk to the crude oil bearish thesis.

**4. BoJ and RBA Divergence Driving FX**
The Bank of Japan's hawkish pivot (0.75% rate, April hike to 1.00% expected) and the RBA's surprise hike to 3.85% on February 3 are the primary drivers of the bullish signals for 6J and 6A respectively. Both central banks are tightening while the Fed holds, creating favorable rate differential dynamics for JPY and AUD.
