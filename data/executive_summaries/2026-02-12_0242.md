# Executive Summary - 2026-02-12

## Data Quality Notes
- All data is fresh as of February 10-12, 2026.
- Fallback source (CNBC) was used for real-time 10-year TIPS yield to supplement FRED data.
- BoJ policy stance is based on historical context due to lack of specific February 2026 meeting data.

## Asset Class Overview
- **Commodities:** MIXED - Silver shows bullishness driven by strong copper and gold ETF inflows, while crude oil is neutral due to a significant inventory build offsetting geopolitical risk premium.
- **Indices:** BULLISH - All four major US indices show a bullish bias, supported by tight credit spreads, falling bond market volatility (MOVE), and a weak US dollar.
- **FX:** SLIGHT_BULLISH - All three tracked currency pairs show a slight bullish bias against the US dollar, primarily driven by broad USD weakness.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a slight bullish bias (+1), supported by a weaker US dollar and continued inflows into gold ETFs. However, flat real yields are limiting further upside. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver has a bullish bias (+3), benefiting from the combined tailwinds of a weaker dollar, rising copper prices indicating industrial demand, and strong inflows into precious metals ETFs. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil is neutral (-1), with bullish geopolitical risk factors being offset by a large weekly inventory build of 8.53 million barrels, which suggests near-term oversupply. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (6/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 shows a bullish bias (+3), driven by narrowing credit spreads, falling VIX, and a weaker US dollar. These factors create a supportive environment for large-cap equities. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq):** The Nasdaq 100 has a bullish bias (+3), benefiting from a weaker dollar, falling bond market volatility (MOVE index), and continued strength in the semiconductor sector (SOX). Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**YM (Dow):** The Dow Jones Industrial Average shows a bullish bias (+3), supported by favorable credit conditions, a steepening yield curve, and broad US dollar weakness. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 has a bullish bias (+4), with small-cap stocks being particularly sensitive to the very tight credit spreads and a steepening yield curve. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (7/10).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro shows a slight bullish bias (+1) against the US dollar, primarily due to broad USD weakness. With both the Fed and ECB on a neutral hold, the rate differential is stable. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar has a slight bullish bias (+2), supported by a hawkish RBA rate hike, rising copper prices, and a weak USD. However, concerns over slowing growth in China are a significant headwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen shows a slight bullish bias (+1), mainly as a result of broad US dollar weakness. The lack of recent BoJ policy guidance and balanced risk mood limit conviction. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (5/10).

## Key Macro Themes
- Broad-based US dollar weakness is a primary driver across asset classes, providing a tailwind for commodities and foreign currencies.
- Credit conditions remain very supportive for equities, with high-yield spreads near historical lows.
- The semiconductor sector (SOX) continues to show strong momentum, signaling risk-on appetite within the tech space.

## Watch List
- Upcoming US inflation data (CPI/PCE) for impact on Fed policy expectations.
- Further developments in geopolitical hotspots, particularly the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Taiwan Strait tensions.
- Next BoJ policy meeting for any signals on future policy normalization path to further policy normalization.
