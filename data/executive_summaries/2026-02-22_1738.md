## Data Quality Notes

All primary data sources were successfully accessed and verified. Gold ETF flow data is based on January 2026 figures (February data not yet published by World Gold Council), resulting in a confidence reduction of 1 point for GC and SI. All FRED data (DFII10, BAMLH0A0HYM2, T10Y2Y) reflects the most recent available observations through February 19-20, 2026; February 20 was Presidents Day (US market holiday), so Friday February 19 data is current. All equity and FX market data reflects the Friday February 20 close, as February 22 is a Sunday.

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities (BULLISH):** All three commodity instruments score SLIGHT_BULLISH (+2), driven by USD structural weakness, a massive crude inventory draw, and continued gold ETF inflows. The accelerating GDPNow estimate at 3.1% provides a modest headwind for precious metals but is offset by favorable supply dynamics.

**Indices (MIXED):** US equity indices present a divergent picture. Tech-heavy ES and NQ score SLIGHT_BULLISH (+2) supported by falling VIX, tight credit spreads, and strong SOX performance. However, YM scores NEUTRAL (-1) and RTY scores NEUTRAL (0) as the accelerating growth narrative (weighted 2x for both) offsets the supportive credit environment. The yield curve's modest flattening adds a further headwind for value and small-cap names.

**FX (BULLISH):** The FX complex is the standout theme of this report. The RBA's surprise 25bp rate hike to 3.85% on February 3 — the first hike in two years — has created a genuine yield advantage for AUD over USD, driving 6A to STRONG_BULLISH (+6). The BoJ's hawkish pivot, with an April hike widely expected, is narrowing the JPY-USD differential and pushing 6J to STRONG_BULLISH (+5). EUR/USD benefits modestly from broad USD weakness, scoring SLIGHT_BULLISH (+1) for M6E.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a slight bullish bias (+2, SLIGHT_BULLISH), supported primarily by USD structural weakness (DXY -1.01% on the month, -8.15% year-over-year) and continued ETF inflows that pushed global gold ETF holdings to all-time highs in January 2026. Real yields are flat at 1.79% (±2bps over the week), providing a neutral rather than supportive backdrop. The accelerating GDPNow estimate of 3.1% for Q1 2026 is a modest headwind, as strong growth reduces safe-haven demand. The key risk is that real yields could rise if the strong growth narrative prompts a re-pricing of Fed cuts. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10). Signal decay consideration: moderate conviction, valid for 2-3 sessions pending next GDPNow update on February 24.

**SI (Silver):** Silver scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+2), benefiting from the same USD weakness and ETF inflow tailwinds as gold, with the additional support of copper rising to $5.90/lb (+1.75% on the day, +26.51% year-over-year). The copper-gold alignment is a favorable setup for silver's dual precious/industrial character. However, the accelerating growth narrative creates conflicting signals — strong industrial demand is bullish for silver's industrial component, but the same growth data is bearish for its precious metal component. Confidence is moderate at 6/10 given these cross-currents. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTREMES or IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Signal decay: 1-2 sessions; watch copper for directional confirmation.

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+2), with the primary driver being the EIA's reported draw of 9.014 million barrels for the week ending February 13 — the largest single-week draw in five months and a stark reversal from the prior week's build of 8.5 million barrels. The market had expected a build of 2.1 million barrels, making this a significant bullish surprise. USD weakness provides an additional tailwind. The accelerating growth narrative (GDPNow 3.1%, weighted 2x for CL) is a headwind, as stronger growth could imply tighter monetary policy and demand concerns. Geopolitical risk is stable. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW long on dips (7/10). Signal decay: 3-5 sessions pending next EIA release on February 25.

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 E-mini scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+2), supported by a trifecta of falling VIX (19.09, down 5.64% on the day), narrowing HY credit spreads (2.88%, near historic lows), and USD weakness. Real yields are flat at 1.79%, providing a neutral backdrop for equity valuations. The accelerating GDPNow is a double-edged factor — strong growth is fundamentally positive for earnings but could delay Fed rate cuts. The VIX remains in the balanced zone (15-20), suggesting neither complacency nor fear. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT long bias (7/10). Signal decay: 2-3 sessions; watch for any reversal in VIX or credit spreads.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+2), with the SOX semiconductor index providing the key incremental driver. SOX closed at 8,260 on Friday, up 1.07% on the day and 13.33% year-to-date, approaching its all-time high of 8,400 set on February 12. The MOVE index falling 5.53% on the day to 64.27 signals declining rate volatility, which is particularly supportive for long-duration growth stocks. Real yields flat at 1.79% are neutral for NQ's valuation. The accelerating growth narrative is a mild headwind. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW with half-size on first entry given NQ's elevated beta (7/10). Signal decay: 2-3 sessions; SOX momentum is the key signal to monitor.

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones E-mini scores NEUTRAL (-1), as the accelerating growth narrative (weighted 2x for YM) offsets the supportive credit environment. The yield curve's modest flattening to 0.60% (from 0.62%) is an additional headwind for the value and cyclical composition of the Dow. Credit spreads narrowing to 2.88% are supportive, but the net weighted score lands in neutral territory. The Dow is the most growth-sensitive of the index instruments in this scoring framework, making the 3.1% GDPNow reading a meaningful drag on the bias. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTREMES or wait for clearer directional signal (6/10). Signal decay: 1-2 sessions; watch next GDPNow update.

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 scores NEUTRAL (0), caught between two powerful opposing forces. Tight credit spreads (HY OAS 2.88%, narrowing) are strongly bullish for small caps given their reliance on bank lending and high-yield markets, and this factor is weighted 2x for RTY. However, the accelerating growth narrative (also weighted 2x) creates uncertainty about the rate path, and the flattening yield curve historically pressures small-cap financials. The conflicting double-weighted factors produce a net neutral score with the lowest confidence in the report at 5/10. Recommended approach: NEUTRAL — reduce size, wait for resolution of growth vs. credit narrative (5/10). Signal decay: 1-2 sessions; RTY most sensitive to any shift in credit conditions.

**M6E (Micro Euro FX):** The Euro scores SLIGHT_BULLISH (+1), with USD weakness as the sole positive driver. Both the Fed (neutral hold at 3.50-3.75%) and the ECB (neutral hold at 2.00% since February 5) are on pause, leaving the rate differential stable and providing no incremental catalyst from the rate side. The EUR-USD differential remains in USD's favor at approximately 150-175bps, but this gap is not widening. Eurozone growth is stable. The primary risk to the bullish bias is any USD recovery or ECB dovish surprise. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTREMES or light long on USD weakness continuation (6/10). Signal decay: 2-3 sessions; watch DXY for directional cue.

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar is the highest-conviction trade in this report, scoring STRONG_BULLISH (+6, confidence 8/10). The RBA's unanimous decision to raise rates by 25bps to 3.85% on February 3 — the first hike in over two years — created a genuine yield advantage for AUD over USD (RBA 3.85% vs Fed 3.50-3.75%). The risk-on environment (VIX falling, credit spreads tight) is doubly weighted for 6A as a commodity currency, adding +2 to the score. Copper at $5.90/lb and near multi-year highs supports AUD's commodity linkage. China's PMI data is mixed (NBS 49.3 contraction vs RatingDog 50.3 expansion), providing a neutral rather than negative read on Australia's largest trade partner. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW long (8/10). Signal decay: 3-5 sessions; the RBA hike is a durable catalyst. Watch for China PMI February data release.

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen scores STRONG_BULLISH (+5, confidence 7/10). The BoJ's hawkish pivot is the dominant driver, with multiple board members signaling readiness for further rate hikes and markets pricing an April 2026 hike. The BoJ raised rates to 0.75% in January — a 30-year high — and the narrowing rate differential between Japan and the US (BoJ hiking while Fed holds) is a structural tailwind for JPY. USD weakness (DXY -8.15% year-over-year) amplifies the move. The risk mood is balanced (VIX 15-20), meaning there is no safe-haven headwind from a risk-on environment. Note: 6J is quoted inversely — STRONG_BULLISH means bullish JPY and bearish USD/JPY. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW long 6J (short USD/JPY) (7/10). Signal decay: 3-5 sessions; BoJ catalyst is durable pending next BoJ meeting.

## Key Macro Themes

The dominant macro narrative entering the week of February 23 is **central bank divergence within a USD weakness regime**. The RBA's surprise hike and the BoJ's hawkish signaling represent the two clearest policy divergences from the Fed's neutral hold, creating directional conviction in AUD and JPY that is absent in most other instruments. The USD's structural decline — down 8% over the past year — provides a broad tailwind for commodities and non-USD FX, though the accelerating GDPNow at 3.1% introduces uncertainty about whether the Fed will remain on hold through mid-year.

The second key theme is **commodity supply tightness**, particularly in crude oil. The 9-million-barrel inventory draw reported by the EIA for the week ending February 13 — the largest in five months — reinforces the bullish supply narrative for CL. Copper's continued strength at $5.90/lb and near multi-year highs supports the broader commodity complex and provides a positive read-through for silver and AUD.

The third theme is **credit market complacency**. HY OAS at 2.88% is near historic lows, and the MOVE index falling to 64 signals that bond market volatility is subdued. This environment is supportive for risk assets broadly, but also represents a potential vulnerability if any macro shock materializes.

## Watch List

The following events could materially shift bias scores in the coming sessions:

**February 24 (Monday):** Atlanta Fed GDPNow update — the current 3.1% estimate for Q1 2026 is a key input for all 10 instruments. Any significant revision higher could pressure YM and RTY further into bearish territory while providing a headwind for GC and SI.

**February 25 (Wednesday):** EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report — the next crude inventory reading will either confirm or reverse the bullish CL narrative. A build would sharply reduce the CL bias score.

**February 26 (Thursday):** US PCE Deflator (January 2026) — the Fed's preferred inflation measure. A hot reading could prompt re-pricing of the March FOMC meeting and shift the Fed stance from neutral to hawkish, which would negatively impact GC, SI, ES, NQ, and M6E.

**March 17 (Tuesday):** Next RBA Board meeting — markets will be watching for signals of a follow-up hike. Any dovish surprise would reduce 6A's STRONG_BULLISH conviction.

**March 18-19 (Wednesday-Thursday):** FOMC meeting — the next major catalyst for all 10 instruments. Current market pricing shows 95.9% probability of no change.
