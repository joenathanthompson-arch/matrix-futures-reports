## ⚠️ CRITICAL OVERNIGHT EVENT: US-Israel Strikes on Iran (Feb 28, 2026)
The US and Israel launched military strikes against Iran on February 28, 2026. Iran has responded with counterstrikes. This is the dominant market driver for this session. Markets are pricing a significant geopolitical risk premium across all asset classes. Gold, silver, and JPY are surging on safe-haven demand. Oil has spiked ~$5/barrel. Equity volatility (VIX, MOVE) is elevated. All strategy recommendations reflect this elevated uncertainty.

## Symbol Analysis
**GC (Gold):** Score +7 (STRONG_BULLISH), Confidence 8/10. Gold is the highest-conviction bullish trade in this report. The US-Iran military conflict has ignited significant safe-haven demand, adding a direct +1 geopolitical premium to an already-bullish macro setup. Falling real yields (DFII10 at 1.74%, down from ~2.0%+ range, weighted 2x = +4) are the structural tailwind, while USD weakness (DXY 97.65, -8.96% YoY = +1) and strong ETF inflows (GLD at 1,097 tonnes, most since April 2022 = +1) confirm the trend. The oil supply disruption risk from Iran adds a further +1. The only headwind is accelerating GDP growth (-1), which reduces pure safe-haven demand. Net +7 is a STRONG_BULLISH read with high conviction. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (8/10). Signal decay: 3-7 sessions (Iran conflict duration-dependent).

**SI (Silver):** Score +5 (STRONG_BULLISH), Confidence 8/10. Silver benefits from the same safe-haven and weak dollar dynamics as gold, with the added industrial metal kicker from copper's strong uptrend (~$6.01/lb, above key $5.97 barrier = +1). Gold ETF inflows provide a sympathetic bid (+1). The Iran conflict adds a direct geopolitical safe-haven premium (+1). Real yields falling (+2) and USD weakness (+1) complete the bullish picture. Growth acceleration is a mild headwind (-1), but silver's industrial demand component partially offsets this. The gold-copper alignment is the key bullish signal — when both are rising, silver historically outperforms. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (8/10). Signal decay: 3-7 sessions.

**CL (Crude Oil):** Score +5 (STRONG_BULLISH), Confidence 6/10. Crude oil has reversed its prior bearish setup due to the Iran conflict. The geopolitical supply disruption risk is now the dominant factor, with oil prices spiking ~$5/barrel to ~$67 WTI on Friday. The oil supply factor (weighted 2x = +2) now reflects tightening/disruption risk from the Iran conflict rather than the prior OPEC+ easing signal. Strong global demand (GDPNow 3.0% Q1 2026, weighted 2x = +2) is now interpreted as demand-positive for crude. Geopolitical risk (+1) and USD weakness (+1) add further support. The only headwind is the massive +16.0 million barrel EIA inventory build for the week ending Feb 20 (-1). Note: OPEC+ confirmed a 206k bpd production hike for April, which is a medium-term bearish factor, but the immediate Iran conflict premium dominates. Confidence is 6/10 (not higher) due to the binary nature of the Iran conflict — de-escalation could rapidly reverse the oil spike. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Signal decay: 1-2 sessions (highly event-dependent).

**ES (S&P 500):** Score +3 (BULLISH), Confidence 6/10. The S&P 500 has a macro-fundamental bullish bias driven by falling real yields (weighted 2x = +4) and USD weakness (+1). However, the Iran conflict is creating significant near-term headwinds: VIX is rising sharply (+6.61% on day = -1) and the MOVE index spiked +14.79% (-1 via credit_spreads proxy). The net +3 reflects the tension between a structurally supportive macro environment and the immediate risk-off shock. Credit spreads remain compressed (HY OAS 2.98%, near multi-year lows = 0, not yet widening). Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Signal decay: 1-3 sessions (Iran-dependent).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** Score +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH), Confidence 6/10. The Nasdaq faces additional headwinds versus the broader S&P 500. The semiconductor index (SOX) fell ~3.5% on Feb 27 (-1), and the MOVE index spike signals bond market stress that historically pressures tech valuations (-1). Falling real yields (2x = +4) and USD weakness (+1) provide the same structural support as ES, but the tech-specific headwinds reduce the net score to +2. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Signal decay: 1-3 sessions.

**YM (Dow Jones):** Score +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH), Confidence 6/10. The Dow benefits from falling real yields (+2), USD weakness (+1), and a steepening yield curve (+1), which is positive for financial sector components. The growth acceleration headwind (weighted 2x = -2) reflects that strong GDP growth reduces the probability of Fed easing, which is the primary catalyst for rate-sensitive Dow components. Credit spreads are flat (0). Net +2 is a SLIGHT_BULLISH read with lower volatility profile than NQ. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Signal decay: 1-3 sessions.

**RTY (Russell 2000):** Score +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH), Confidence 6/10. Small caps are caught between supportive factors and headwinds. Falling real yields (+2), USD weakness (+1), and a steepening yield curve (+1) provide support. However, the growth acceleration headwind (weighted 2x = -2) is significant for small caps, and credit spreads are flat (0) rather than the prior tightening signal. The Iran conflict adds uncertainty for domestically-focused small caps. RANGE_TRADE approach is recommended given the conflicting signals. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (6/10). Signal decay: 1-3 sessions.

**6E (Euro):** Score +1 (SLIGHT_BULLISH), Confidence 5/10. The euro's bullish case is thin but present. The only positive driver is USD weakness (DXY -0.14% day, -8.96% YoY = +1). The ECB held rates at 2.00% on Feb 5 (neutral hold = 0), the Fed is also on neutral hold (= 0), and the rate differential between the two is stable at approximately 150bps USD premium (= 0 for EUR). Eurozone growth is modest and stable (= 0). The Iran conflict is a mild negative for EUR as Europe is more exposed to Middle East energy supply disruptions, but this is not yet reflected in the factor model. Score of +1 reflects that EUR/USD is primarily a USD story — the weak dollar is the driver, not eurozone-specific strength. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (5/10). Signal decay: 3-5 sessions.

**6A (Australian Dollar):** Score +2 (SLIGHT_BULLISH), Confidence 6/10. The Australian dollar has a mixed setup. The RBA's hawkish hike to 3.85% on Feb 3 (+1 for RBA stance) has made AUD rates higher than USD rates, creating a favorable rate differential (+1). Copper's strong uptrend (+1) is directly bullish for AUD as Australia's primary export. USD weakness provides additional tailwind (+1). However, China's manufacturing PMI declining toward ~49.1 (contraction territory, weighted 2x = -2) is a significant headwind, as China is Australia's largest trading partner. Risk sentiment is neutral (0). The prior report scored 6A at +4 with China growth at 0 (neutral); the updated China PMI data showing contraction reduces the score to +2. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Signal decay: 3-5 sessions.

**6J (Japanese Yen):** Score +6 (STRONG_BULLISH), Confidence 8/10. The yen is the second-highest-conviction trade in this report, behind only gold. Three factors are firing bullish simultaneously: BoJ hawkish normalization (policy rate at 1.0% since January 2026, continuing to narrow the Fed-BoJ differential, weighted 2x = +2), the narrowing rate differential (BoJ hiking path reduces the 250-275bps USD premium, weighted 2x = +2), and USD weakness (+1). The Iran conflict adds a safe-haven demand premium for JPY (+1), as the yen is a traditional safe-haven currency. Note: 6J is inverted — STRONG_BULLISH means JPY strengthening, USD/JPY falling. USD/JPY is currently in the 152-158 range; the BoJ normalization theme is a multi-week directional trade. Recommended approach: TREND_FOLLOW (8/10). Signal decay: 7-10 sessions (policy divergence theme is multi-week; Iran safe-haven adds near-term momentum).

## Key Macro Themes
**Theme 1 — US-Iran Conflict as Dominant Near-Term Driver:** The military escalation between the US/Israel and Iran is the single most important market event for this session. It is driving safe-haven flows into gold (+7), silver (+5), and JPY (+6), while spiking oil prices (+5 for CL). The MOVE index spiked +14.79% and VIX is rising, signaling elevated volatility across all asset classes. The binary nature of the conflict (escalation vs. de-escalation) means signal decay for conflict-driven scores is 1-3 sessions.

**Theme 2 — Falling Real Yields as Universal Structural Tailwind:** DFII10 at 1.74% and declining from the ~2.0%+ range remains the dominant structural macro factor. It is the primary driver of bullish signals across gold, silver, all four equity indices, and the FX complex. US bonds wrapped up their biggest monthly rally in a year (Bloomberg, Feb 27). As long as real yields continue falling, the path of least resistance for risk assets remains higher — but the Iran conflict is creating a temporary divergence between structural and tactical signals.

**Theme 3 — BoJ Policy Divergence Accelerating:** The Bank of Japan raised its policy rate to 1.0% at the January 2026 MPM, and the normalization path continues despite Tokyo CPI slipping below 2% in February. The BoJ-Fed rate differential is narrowing, making 6J the highest-conviction directional trade on a multi-week basis. The Iran conflict adds a near-term safe-haven boost to an already-strong structural case.

## Watch List
The US-Iran conflict is the primary watch item — any de-escalation signals would rapidly reduce the geopolitical premium in GC, SI, CL, and 6J. China February PMI releases on March 2 — a reading below 49.0 would further pressure 6A. FRED DFII10, T10Y2Y, and HY OAS all update March 2 (first business day after the weekend). The next EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report is March 4. US NFP is March 6. The next RBA meeting is March 17, 2026 — watch for follow-through hawkish signals. BoJ's next scheduled meeting is March 18-19, 2026 — the ongoing normalization path makes this a high-impact event for 6J. FOMC meeting is March 18-19, 2026 — 92.6% probability of no change.
