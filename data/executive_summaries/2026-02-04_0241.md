# Executive Summary - February 4, 2026

## Data Quality Notes

Gold ETF flow data was unavailable from the World Gold Council. CNBC was used as a fallback for real yields as FRED data was one day old. All other data sources are current as of February 3-4, 2026.

## Asset Class Overview

**Commodities:** MIXED - Silver and crude show slight bullish bias driven by copper strength and oil inventory draws, while gold remains neutral in a flat macro environment.

**Indices:** SLIGHT_BULLISH - Three of four equity indices show positive bias, supported primarily by narrowing credit spreads. Small caps (RTY) lead with highest conviction.

**FX:** NEUTRAL - All three major currency pairs show neutral to slight bullish bias with no strong directional drivers from central banks or rate differentials.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a neutral bias (0), reflecting a flat macro environment across all major drivers. Real yields are unchanged, the dollar is flat, and the Fed remains on hold. Without clear directional catalysts and missing ETF flow data, gold lacks conviction in either direction. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (5/10). Wait for breakout confirmation before taking directional positions.

**SI (Silver):** Silver registers a slight bullish bias (+1), primarily supported by rising copper prices which signal industrial demand strength. However, the broader precious metals complex remains subdued with neutral gold readings. Silver's hybrid nature as both precious and industrial metal creates mixed signals. Recommended approach: COPPER_CORRELATION_PLAY (5/10). Consider silver only if copper continues its uptrend.

**CL (Crude):** Crude oil shows a slight bullish bias (+2), driven by inventory draws (down 2.3 million barrels) and elevated geopolitical tensions including tariff threats and Greenland disputes. U.S. commercial crude inventories sit about 3% below the five-year average. Growth remains stable at 4.2%, supporting demand expectations. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10). Focus on inventory-driven momentum and geopolitical headlines.

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 displays a slight bullish bias (+1), supported by narrowing credit spreads which indicate improving financial conditions. High-yield spreads have compressed to 2.81%, down from recent highs. However, VIX remains elevated at 18 and real yields are flat, limiting upside conviction. Growth is stable but not accelerating. Recommended approach: CREDIT_SPREAD_PLAY (6/10). Monitor credit conditions closely as the primary driver.

**NQ (Nasdaq):** The Nasdaq shows a neutral bias (0) with conflicting signals. Falling semiconductor prices (SOX down 2.07% and 4.48% over five days) create a headwind for tech, while declining bond volatility (MOVE down 2.96%) provides support. Real yields remain flat, offering no directional catalyst for rate-sensitive tech names. Recommended approach: WAIT_AND_SEE (5/10). Avoid directional bets until SOX stabilizes or real yields provide a clear signal.

**YM (Dow):** The Dow Jones shows a slight bullish bias (+1), benefiting from narrowing credit spreads which support value-oriented and cyclical names. Stable growth at 4.2% and a flat yield curve provide a constructive backdrop for industrial and financial components. Lower beta than tech-heavy indices makes it a cleaner vehicle in mixed conditions. Recommended approach: VALUE_ROTATION (6/10). Favor over NQ in current environment.

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 registers a slight bullish bias (+2) with the highest conviction among equity indices (7/10). Small caps are highly sensitive to credit conditions, and the sharp narrowing of high-yield spreads provides strong tailwinds. Domestic growth remains stable at 4.2%, supporting small-cap fundamentals. Credit spreads receive double weighting in the RTY model, making this the most compelling equity play. Recommended approach: CREDIT_DRIVEN_LONG (7/10). Best risk-reward among indices given credit spread dynamics.

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro shows a neutral bias (0) with no clear directional drivers. Both the Fed and ECB remain on hold, rate differentials are stable, and the dollar is flat. Eurozone growth data shows no recent changes. Risk sentiment is balanced with VIX at 18. Without catalyst from monetary policy divergence or growth surprises, EUR/USD lacks conviction. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (5/10). Wait for central bank policy shifts before taking directional positions.

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian dollar shows a slight bullish bias (+1), supported primarily by rising copper prices which correlate with China demand expectations. However, conviction is limited as China growth data remains stable rather than accelerating, and risk sentiment is neutral. The RBA remains on hold with no rate differential changes versus the Fed. Recommended approach: COMMODITY_CORRELATION (5/10). AUD strength depends on sustained copper rally and China stimulus signals.

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese yen shows a neutral bias (0) with no directional catalyst. The BoJ remains dovish with no hawkish pivot, rate differentials versus the Fed are stable, and risk sentiment is balanced. The yen typically strengthens in risk-off environments, but VIX at 18 suggests neither extreme fear nor complacency. Without BoJ policy shifts or risk-off catalysts, JPY lacks conviction. Recommended approach: SAFE_HAVEN_HEDGE (5/10). Hold as portfolio hedge rather than directional trade. Note that 6J quotes are inverted (higher = stronger JPY = weaker USD/JPY).

## Key Macro Themes

The macro environment is characterized by stability and balance across most factors. The Federal Reserve remains on hold with 91% probability of maintaining rates at 350-375 bps through the March meeting. Real yields are flat at 1.93%, providing no directional catalyst for rate-sensitive assets. Growth remains robust at 4.2% according to the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model, unchanged from the prior reading. The standout theme is credit market improvement, with high-yield spreads narrowing to 2.81%, which provides the strongest support for risk assets, particularly small-cap equities. Geopolitical tensions have elevated slightly with tariff threats and Greenland disputes, supporting safe-haven and energy assets. Overall, the environment favors selective risk-taking in credit-sensitive sectors rather than broad directional bets.
