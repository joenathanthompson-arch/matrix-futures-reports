- **Indices:** BULLISH - Cyclical and small-cap indices are showing strength, driven by narrowing credit spreads and a steepening yield curve, though a rising VIX and hawkish Fed are creating headwinds for the broader market.

## Symbol Analysis

**GC (Gold):** Gold shows a slight bullish bias (+1), supported by a weaker US Dollar and continued ETF inflows. However, a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve is creating a headwind, capping upside potential. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (6/10).

**SI (Silver):** Silver has a slight bullish bias (+1), mirroring gold's price action with support from a weaker dollar and ETF inflows. The lack of strong momentum in copper and a hawkish Fed are limiting conviction. Recommended approach: FADE_EXTREMES (5/10).

**CL (Crude Oil):** Crude oil has a bullish bias (+3), driven by a recent inventory draw, elevated geopolitical risk, and a weak US Dollar. These factors are currently outweighing concerns about a hawkish Fed. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**ES (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 has a neutral bias (0) as conflicting signals are creating a choppy environment. While narrowing credit spreads are supportive, a rising VIX and a hawkish Fed are creating significant headwinds. Recommended approach: WAIT_FOR_CLARITY (6/10).

**NQ (Nasdaq 100):** The Nasdaq 100 shows a slight bullish bias (+2), with strong performance in the semiconductor sector and falling bond market volatility providing support. However, a hawkish Fed is a key risk for the rate-sensitive tech sector. Recommended approach: BUY_DIPS (6/10).

**YM (Dow Jones):** The Dow Jones has a slight bullish bias (+2), benefiting from a steepening yield curve and narrowing credit spreads which are supportive of cyclical and financial stocks. A hawkish Fed remains a headwind. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (6/10).

**RTY (Russell 2000):** The Russell 2000 shows a bullish bias (+3), with small caps being strongly supported by narrowing credit spreads, which have a double weighting in this model. A steepening yield curve is also a positive factor. Recommended approach: IB_BREAKOUT (7/10).

**M6E (Euro):** The Euro has a slight bearish bias (-2) against the US Dollar. The widening interest rate differential between the hawkish Fed and the neutral ECB is the primary driver of this weakness. Recommended approach: SELL_RALLIES (6/10).

**6A (Australian Dollar):** The Australian Dollar has a neutral bias (0) as the bullish impact of a recent RBA rate hike is being offset by a broader risk-off sentiment, indicated by the rising VIX. Recommended approach: RANGE_TRADE (5/10).

**6J (Japanese Yen):** The Japanese Yen has a neutral bias (0). While a weaker US Dollar is providing some support, the lack of a clear signal from the Bank of Japan and a mixed risk environment are keeping it in a range. Recommended approach: WAIT_FOR_CLARITY (5/10).

## Key Macro Themes
- The Federal Reserve's hawkish hold is the dominant theme, creating a challenging environment for risk assets.
- Credit markets remain supportive of equities, with narrowing spreads providing a tailwind for cyclical and small-cap stocks.
- A rising VIX indicates increasing investor fear, which could lead to further volatility and a flight to safety.

## Watch List
- Upcoming speeches from FOMC members for further clues on the path of monetary policy.
- Next week's EIA petroleum status report for confirmation of the recent inventory draw.
