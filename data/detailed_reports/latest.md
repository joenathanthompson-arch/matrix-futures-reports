## GC (Gold) - Score: +3 (BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Real yields | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Oil supply shock | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Gold ETF flows | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+3** |

### Analysis
Gold shows a bullish bias supported by the Fed's dovish hold stance and continued USD weakness. While real yields remain flat (removing a potential headwind), geopolitical tensions around Greenland and tariff threats are driving safe-haven inflows into gold ETFs. The combination of a weakening dollar (down 2.08% over the month to 96.83) and rising geopolitical risk provides a solid foundation for gold prices. The Fed's increasingly dovish posture, with rising market expectations for rate cuts, further supports the precious metal.

### Recommended Approach
IB_BREAKOUT on geopolitical headlines (7/10 confidence). Gold is well-positioned to break out of recent ranges if geopolitical tensions escalate or if the Fed signals more dovish intent at the March meeting.

---

## SI (Silver) - Score: +4 (BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Real yields | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Copper | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Gold ETF flows | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+4** |

### Analysis
Silver displays a bullish bias, benefiting from both its precious metal characteristics (weak USD, dovish Fed) and industrial demand signals (rising copper prices). The hybrid nature of silver positions it well in the current environment where both safe-haven demand and growth indicators are supportive. Rising copper prices (+0.34% today to $5.99/lb) signal healthy industrial demand, while gold ETF inflows indicate continued safe-haven interest. The combination of these factors creates a more bullish outlook for silver than gold.

### Recommended Approach
MOMENTUM_FOLLOW with copper confirmation (6/10 confidence). Silver's dual nature creates some uncertainty, so confirmation from copper price action is important before committing to the trade.

## CL (WTI Crude) - Score: +1 (SLIGHT_BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Oil supply shock | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| Inventories | -1 | 1 | -1 |
| Growth narrative | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| Geopolitical risk | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+1** |

### Analysis
Crude oil shows a slight bullish bias, with conflicting signals creating a more cautious outlook. Geopolitical risk (Greenland tensions, tariff threats) and USD weakness provide support, but the recent inventory build of 8.5 million barrels (largest in a year, bringing total to 428.8 million barrels) is a significant bearish factor. Growth remains stable at 3.7% but is not accelerating, which limits demand-side support. The inventory overhang limits upside potential despite the geopolitical premium being priced in.

### Recommended Approach
RANGE_TRADE between support/resistance (5/10 confidence). The conflicting signals suggest crude oil will likely trade in a range until either inventories start drawing or geopolitical tensions escalate significantly.

---

## ES (S&P 500) - Score: +4 (BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Real yields | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Credit spreads | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| VIX direction | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+4** |

### Analysis
The S&P 500 exhibits a bullish bias driven by the Fed's dovish hold stance, narrowing credit spreads (down to 286bps from 300+), and falling VIX (down 20% over five days to 17.39). The combination of accommodative monetary policy expectations and improving risk sentiment creates a favorable environment for broad equity exposure. Real yields remain flat at 1.825%, removing a potential headwind for equities. The narrowing credit spreads signal improving corporate credit conditions and investor confidence.

### Recommended Approach
IB_BREAKOUT on credit spread tightening (7/10 confidence). The S&P 500 is positioned to break out to new highs if credit spreads continue to narrow and the Fed maintains its dovish stance.

---

## NQ (Nasdaq 100) - Score: +4 (BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Real yields | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| SOX (Semis) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| MOVE (Rates vol) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+4** |

### Analysis
The Nasdaq 100 shows a bullish bias supported by dovish Fed policy, strong semiconductor performance (SOX up 9.47% over the month to 8,291.86), and falling bond volatility (MOVE index down 4.96% to 61.35). The tech-heavy index benefits from the growth-friendly environment and declining rate volatility. Flat real yields are particularly supportive for duration-sensitive tech stocks. The strong performance of semiconductors signals healthy demand for technology products and services.

### Recommended Approach
MOMENTUM_FOLLOW with SOX leadership (7/10 confidence). The Nasdaq 100 should continue to perform well as long as semiconductors maintain their leadership and bond volatility remains subdued.

---

## YM (Dow Jones) - Score: +4 (BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Real yields | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| Credit spreads | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| 2s10s curve | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+4** |

### Analysis
The Dow Jones displays a bullish bias benefiting from the reflation trade as evidenced by the steepening yield curve (2s10s at 66bps, up from negative levels). Narrowing credit spreads and dovish Fed policy support cyclical and value-oriented names that dominate the Dow. The curve steepening signals improving growth expectations and eventual Fed easing, which favors the Dow's composition of mature, dividend-paying companies. The combination of stable growth (3.7%) and accommodative policy creates an ideal environment for Dow components.

### Recommended Approach
IB_BREAKOUT on curve steepening continuation (6/10 confidence). The Dow is well-positioned to outperform if the yield curve continues to steepen and growth remains stable.

---

## RTY (Russell 2000) - Score: +5 (STRONG_BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Real yields | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Growth narrative | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| Credit spreads | +1 | 2 | +2 |
| 2s10s curve | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+5** |

### Analysis
The Russell 2000 shows a strong bullish bias (+5), the highest among equity indices. Small caps are particularly sensitive to credit conditions, and the narrowing of high-yield spreads to 286bps (from 300+) is a powerful bullish signal. The dovish Fed and steepening curve (66bps) further support domestically-focused small caps. Small cap companies typically have higher debt loads and are more sensitive to financing costs, making the narrowing credit spreads especially beneficial. This is the strongest equity signal in the current environment.

### Recommended Approach
MOMENTUM_FOLLOW on credit spread narrowing (7/10 confidence). The Russell 2000 should continue to outperform as long as credit spreads remain tight and the Fed maintains its dovish stance.

---

## M6E (Euro) - Score: +4 (BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| ECB stance | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Rate differential (EUR-USD) | +1 | 2 | +2 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Eurozone growth | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+4** |

### Analysis
The Euro exhibits a bullish bias (+4) against the USD, driven primarily by the divergence in central bank stances. While the ECB is holding rates steady at 2.00% (extending its longest pause since below-zero days), the Fed's increasingly dovish posture (94% probability of hold but rising cut expectations) is narrowing the rate differential in favor of the Euro. The weak USD (down 2.08% over the month to 96.83) provides additional support. The rate differential is scored +1 because the Fed is becoming more dovish relative to the ECB's neutral stance, which is bullish for EUR.

### Recommended Approach
TREND_FOLLOW on Fed/ECB divergence (6/10 confidence). The Euro should continue to strengthen as long as the Fed maintains its dovish stance while the ECB remains on hold.

## 6A (Australian Dollar) - Score: +5 (STRONG_BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| RBA stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Rate differential (AUD-USD) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk sentiment | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| China growth | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| Copper | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+5** |

### Analysis
The Australian Dollar shows a strong bullish bias (+5), supported by multiple factors. The RBA's recent 25bp hike to 3.85% on February 3 (with 75% probability of another hike to 4.10% by May) contrasts sharply with the Fed's dovish stance, creating a favorable rate differential. The RBA warned that rates must remain restrictive to combat persistent inflationary pressures, signaling a hawkish bias. Rising copper prices (+0.34% today to $5.99/lb) provide additional support given Australia's commodity export profile. Weak USD (down 2.08% over the month) creates a tailwind. This is one of the strongest FX signals.

### Recommended Approach
IB_BREAKOUT on RBA hawkishness (7/10 confidence). The Australian Dollar is positioned to break out to new highs if the RBA delivers another hike and copper prices continue to rise.

## 6J (Japanese Yen) - Score: +6 (STRONG_BULLISH)

### Weighted Factor Breakdown
| Factor | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Fed stance | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| BoJ stance | +1 | 2 | +2 |
| Rate differential (JPY-USD) | +1 | 2 | +2 |
| USD (DXY) | +1 | 1 | +1 |
| Risk mood | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **+6** |

### Analysis
The Japanese Yen displays the strongest bullish bias (+6) across all instruments. The Bank of Japan's hawkish stance (potential rate hikes as early as March, up to 3 times in 2026 according to Mizuho) creates a powerful divergence against the dovish Fed. The ruling bloc's landslide election victory on February 9 supports continued tightening, and Prime Minister Takaichi's concern about yen weakness adds political pressure for a stronger yen. The BoJ could raise rates from current levels, with markets pricing in significant tightening ahead. Note that bullish 6J means bullish JPY, which translates to bearish USD/JPY due to inverted quoting conventions.

### Recommended Approach
TREND_FOLLOW on BoJ policy divergence (8/10 confidence). The Japanese Yen should continue to strengthen as long as the BoJ maintains its hawkish stance and the Fed remains dovish. This is the highest conviction trade in the current environment.

## Key Macro Themes

### Central Bank Policy Divergence
The dominant macro narrative is central bank policy divergence. The Federal Reserve's dovish hold stance (with dissent for cuts and rising market expectations for easing) stands in stark contrast to the hawkish postures of the Bank of Japan and Reserve Bank of Australia. The Fed is holding rates steady with a 94% probability, but market expectations for rate cuts are building ahead of the March 18-19 FOMC meeting. Meanwhile, the BoJ is signaling potential rate hikes as early as March (up to 3 times in 2026), and the RBA just raised rates by 25bp to 3.85% with a 75% probability of another hike by May. This divergence is driving broad-based USD weakness (DXY down 2.08% over the month to 96.83) and creating strong tailwinds for foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and Australian Dollar.

### Improving Risk Environment
The second key theme is the improving risk environment. Credit spreads have narrowed to 286bps from 300+ levels, signaling improving corporate credit conditions and investor confidence. The VIX has fallen sharply (down 20% over five days to 17.39), indicating declining equity volatility and improving risk sentiment. Bond volatility (MOVE index) is also declining (down 4.96% to 61.35), creating a more stable environment for rate-sensitive assets. This combination signals increasing investor confidence and appetite for risk. The yield curve steepening (2s10s at 66bps, up from negative levels) suggests markets are pricing in a soft landing scenario with stable growth (GDPNow at 3.7%) and eventual Fed easing, which is particularly supportive for cyclical and value-oriented equities.

### Mixed Commodity Picture
The third theme is the mixed commodity picture. Precious metals (gold and silver) are benefiting from geopolitical risk (Greenland tensions, tariff threats) and USD weakness, with gold ETF inflows indicating safe-haven demand. Industrial metals like copper are rising (+0.34% today to $5.99/lb), signaling underlying growth resilience and supporting commodity currencies like the Australian Dollar. However, crude oil faces headwinds from a significant inventory build (8.5 million barrels, the largest in a year, bringing total to 428.8 million barrels). This divergence within commodities reflects the complex interplay between safe-haven demand, growth expectations, and supply-demand dynamics. The oil inventory build suggests demand is not keeping pace with supply despite stable growth, which limits upside potential for crude.

---

## Watch List

### March 18-19 FOMC Meeting
The next Fed meeting is 34 days away, and market expectations for rate cuts are building. Any shift in the Fed's forward guidance could significantly impact the current dovish narrative and USD weakness trend. The Fed's dot plot and economic projections will be closely watched for signals about the timing and magnitude of potential rate cuts.

### BoJ March Meeting
With markets pricing in potential rate hikes as early as March, the Bank of Japan's next decision will be critical for the JPY strength trade. Further hawkish signals could extend the 6J rally and create additional pressure on USD/JPY. The BoJ's communication about the pace and magnitude of future tightening will be key.

### RBA May Meeting
Markets are pricing a 75% probability of another 25bp hike to 4.10% by May. Australian inflation data in Q1 will be crucial in determining whether the RBA continues its tightening cycle. Any signs of persistent inflation would support further RBA tightening and AUD strength.

### Credit Spread Levels
The narrowing of high-yield spreads to 286bps is a key support for risk assets, particularly small caps (RTY). Any reversal or widening would be an early warning signal for equity weakness. Monitor the BAMLH0A0HYM2 series on FRED for daily updates.

### VIX Levels
After falling 20% over five days to 17.39, the VIX is in the "balanced" range (15-20). A break below 15 would signal extreme complacency and potential for a volatility spike, while a move above 20 would indicate rising risk aversion and potential equity weakness.

### Oil Inventories
The 8.5 million barrel build was the largest in a year, bringing total inventories to 428.8 million barrels (3% below the five-year average). Next week's EIA report will be important to determine if this was a one-time event or the start of a bearish trend for crude oil. Watch for any signs of demand weakness or supply increases.

### Geopolitical Developments
Ongoing tensions around Greenland and tariff threats are supporting gold and creating uncertainty. Any escalation could drive additional safe-haven flows into gold and JPY, while de-escalation could reduce the geopolitical premium and weaken these assets. Monitor news flow closely for developments.

## Data Quality and Methodology Notes

Some FRED data sources (DFII10 for real yields, BAMLH0A0HYM2 for credit spreads, T10Y2Y for yield curve) were 1-2 days stale as of this report generation. Used CNBC US10YTIP as fallback for real yields to ensure current pricing. All other sources (CME FedWatch, TradingView for DXY/VIX/SOX/MOVE, EIA for oil inventories, central bank statements) are current as of February 12, 2026.

Scoring methodology follows the weighted factor approach outlined in the Macro_Bias_Scorer_Reference.md document. Each instrument has specific factors with assigned weights (1x or 2x) that are summed to produce the final bias score. Signal thresholds are: ≤-5 = STRONG_BEARISH, -4 to -3 = BEARISH, -2 to -1 = SLIGHT_BEARISH, 0 = NEUTRAL, +1 to +2 = SLIGHT_BULLISH, +3 to +4 = BULLISH, ≥+5 = STRONG_BULLISH.

Confidence scores (1-10) reflect data quality, clarity of drivers, and signal strength. Higher confidence indicates fresher data, clearer directional drivers, and stronger factor alignment.
