Executive Summary (Conviction: MIXED, with bullish commodities/cyclicals and neutral duration assets)

Key Drivers:
1.  **Divergence in Equities:** A clear split is emerging between duration-sensitive growth stocks (pressured by yields) and cyclical/value stocks (supported by credit and growth).
2.  **Commodity Strength:** The combination of a weak dollar and specific supply/demand stories (oil draw, copper strength) is driving a bullish outlook for the commodity complex.
3.  **Credit is King:** Tight credit spreads are the primary driver of support for equities, particularly for more credit-sensitive small caps, overriding some of the concerns from rising rates.
