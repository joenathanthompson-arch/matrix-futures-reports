Hot PPI data (Core +0.8% MoM) is the key late-session development: it reduces near-term Fed cut expectations and is bearish for equities (ES, NQ, YM, RTY scores reduced by 1 from earlier draft). Chicago PMI 57.7 is a positive growth signal but creates stagflation concern alongside hot PPI. CL score adjusted from -2 to -1 to reflect the US-Iran geopolitical risk spike that drove WTI +2.8% to $67.02 close."
