## News Summary

### Futures
- **General Market:** US stock futures are pointing to a higher open, continuing the strong rally from Friday. The market is digesting the recent batch of economic data which points to a resilient economy, but not so strong as to force the Fed's hand. The focus this week will be on upcoming inflation data.
- **Commodities:** Gold and silver are holding onto their recent gains, supported by a weaker dollar and falling real yields. Crude oil is trading in a tight range as the market weighs a large inventory draw against a stable demand outlook.

### Currency
- **USD:** The dollar is broadly weaker against most major currencies, pressured by falling US Treasury yields.
- **JPY:** The Yen is showing strength ahead of the Lower House elections and key economic data releases. The market is pricing in a continued normalization of policy from the Bank of Japan.
- **EUR & AUD:** The Euro and Australian Dollar are trading in a mixed fashion, caught between a weaker USD and their own domestic cross-currents.
