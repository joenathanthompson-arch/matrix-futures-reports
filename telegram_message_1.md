# Matrix Futures Daily Bias Report - January 26, 2026

**Author**: Manus AI

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a quantitative daily bias assessment for six key futures instruments based on a structured analysis of 14 real-time macroeconomic factors. The scoring methodology, detailed in the reference documentation, uses integer-based calculations and weighted matrices to derive a directional bias and a corresponding PM Score (1-10 scale).

Today's analysis reveals a predominantly **neutral market sentiment**, with five of the six instruments registering a neutral signal. The standout is **WTI Crude Oil (CL)**, which shows a **slight bearish bias** driven by a significant build in inventories and an easing supply shock outlook. Across the board, the Federal Reserve's anticipated hawkish hold at the upcoming FOMC meeting is a primary factor tempering bullish enthusiasm, despite positive signals from a weakening US Dollar, strong ETF inflows into gold, and robust semiconductor market performance.

### Key Insights:
- **FOMC Dominance**: The upcoming FOMC meeting (Jan 28-29) is the most significant market-moving event this week. The consensus expectation of the Fed holding rates at 3.25-3.50% while maintaining a hawkish tone is creating a cautious environment, limiting upside potential across risk assets.
- **Crude Oil Weakness**: A larger-than-expected build in crude oil inventories (+3.6M barrels vs. +1.1M expected) is the primary driver of the bearish signal in CL. This suggests that supply is currently outpacing demand, a trend that is further reinforced by the easing of the broader oil supply shock narrative.
- **Growth vs. Fed Tension**: A strong growth narrative, evidenced by the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast of 5.4%, is being directly counteracted by the Fed's restrictive monetary policy stance. This tension is a key reason for the neutral readings in the major equity indices (ES, NQ, YM).
- **Geopolitical Risk on the Rise**: Heightened tensions with Iran and ongoing US-China friction are contributing to a rising geopolitical risk environment. While this provides some support for safe-haven assets like Gold, its impact is currently overshadowed by the more dominant macroeconomic drivers.

## 2. Detailed Instrument Analysis

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the bias calculation for each of the six futures instruments. Each analysis includes the specific weight matrix used, the raw scores for each contributing macro factor, and the final calculated weighted score and corresponding signal.

### GC (Gold)

Gold registered a **Neutral** signal with a total weighted score of **-1**. The primary headwinds are the hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve and a strong economic growth narrative, which tend to diminish the appeal of non-yielding assets like gold. However, these bearish factors are effectively counterbalanced by a weakening US Dollar (DXY) and continued strong inflows into gold-backed ETFs, which provide significant underlying support.

| Category | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Real yields | **2** | 0 | **0** |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| Risk mood | 1 | 0 | **0** |
| Growth narrative | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Oil supply shock | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Gold ETF flows | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| **Total** | | | **-1** |

### SI (Silver)

Silver scored a **Neutral** signal with a total weighted score of **+1**. Similar to gold, silver is feeling the pressure from a hawkish Fed. However, its industrial demand component provides a bullish offset, as evidenced by the strength in the copper market. This, combined with a weaker US Dollar and strong precious metals ETF inflows, results in a balanced outlook.

| Category | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Real yields | 1 | 0 | **0** |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| Risk mood | 1 | 0 | **0** |
| Growth narrative | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Copper | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| Gold ETF flows | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| **Total** | | | **+1** |

### ES (S&P 500)

The S&P 500 produced a **Neutral** signal with a total weighted score of **0**. The index is caught in a tug-of-war between a robust economic growth forecast and tightening financial conditions from the Federal Reserve. While narrowing credit spreads and a weaker dollar are supportive of equities, the heavily weighted negative impact of the Fed's policy creates a perfectly balanced, neutral score.

| Category | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Real yields | **2** | 0 | **0** |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| Risk mood (VIX) | 1 | 0 | **0** |
| Growth narrative | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Credit spreads (HY OAS) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| VIX | 1 | 0 | **0** |
| **Total** | | | **0** |

### NQ (Nasdaq 100)

The Nasdaq 100 shows a **Neutral** signal with a slight positive lean, scoring **+1**. The technology-heavy index is benefiting from the continued strength in the semiconductor sector (SOX) and a notable decline in interest rate volatility (MOVE index). These factors, combined with a weaker US Dollar, are just enough to outweigh the negative pressure from the hawkish Fed and strong growth narrative, which can sometimes signal a rotation away from growth stocks.

| Category | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Real yields | **2** | 0 | **0** |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| Risk mood (VIX) | 1 | 0 | **0** |
| Growth narrative | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| SOX (Semis) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| MOVE (Rates vol) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| **Total** | | | **+1** |

### YM (Dow Jones)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average calculated a **Neutral** signal with a score of **0**. The strong growth narrative, which carries a double weight for this index, is the primary bearish driver. However, this is fully offset by positive contributions from narrowing credit spreads, a steepening yield curve (2s10s), and a weaker US Dollar, resulting in a perfectly neutral stance.

| Category | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fed stance | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Real yields | 1 | 0 | **0** |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| Risk mood (VIX) | 1 | 0 | **0** |
| Growth narrative | **2** | -1 | **-2** |
| Credit spreads (HY OAS) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| 2s10s curve | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| **Total** | | | **0** |

### CL (WTI Crude Oil)

WTI Crude Oil is the only instrument with a clear directional bias today, registering a **Slight Bearish** signal with a score of **-3**. The primary drivers are a significant build in crude oil inventories and an easing of the broader oil supply shock narrative, both of which carry a double weight in the calculation. These factors indicate that supply is currently robust, outweighing the bullish influence of rising geopolitical risk and a weaker US Dollar.

| Category | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Oil supply shock | **2** | -1 | **-2** |
| Inventories | 1 | -1 | **-1** |
| Growth narrative | **2** | -1 | **-2** |
| Geopolitical risk | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| USD (DXY) | 1 | +1 | **+1** |
| **Total** | | | **-3** |
