## II. Market News & Commentary

### Futures Market News

Equity futures are mixed but holding near recent highs after the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, a move that was widely anticipated by the market. The S&P 500 briefly crossed the 7000-point threshold for the first time. The Nasdaq continues to show strength, fueled by the ongoing AI-fueled rally. Commodity futures, particularly precious metals and oil, are seeing significant upward momentum. Gold has surpassed $5,000 per ounce, driven by a weaker dollar, lower real yields, and escalating geopolitical tensions. Oil prices are also elevated due to the increasing risk premium associated with the Iran-US conflict.

### Currency Market News

The US Dollar is broadly weaker against major currencies, a trend that is expected to continue given the Federal Reserve's dovish stance. The Australian Dollar has hit a fresh 3-year peak, supported by a hawkish RBA and strong commodity prices. The Japanese Yen has also rallied as the Bank of Japan signals further rate hikes. The Euro is holding firm, though ECB policymakers have expressed concerns about the currency's rapid appreciation.
