## Executive Summary

### Data Quality Notes
- FRED data for High Yield OAS (BAMLH0A0HYM2) was 2 days stale; the narrowing trend is clear and consistent with other market indicators.
- Real yields were sourced from CNBC (US10YTIP) for the most current data, though FRED data was also recent.

### Asset Class Overview
- **Commodities:** BULLISH - Gold and Silver are strongly bullish due to falling real yields and a weak dollar. Crude is bullish, supported by geopolitical risk and a weak dollar, despite a recent large inventory build.
- **Indices:** STRONG_BULLISH - All four major US indices show a strong bullish bias. The environment of falling real yields, a dovish Fed hold, tight credit spreads, and a falling VIX is highly supportive of equities.
- **FX:** SLIGHT_BULLISH - All three currency pairs show a slight bullish bias against the USD, primarily driven by broad dollar weakness and specific central bank actions (hawkish RBA).

### Key Macro Themes
- **Falling Real Yields and Dovish Fed:** The primary driver across markets is the combination of a Federal Reserve on hold and falling real yields, which boosts the attractiveness of risk assets and non-yielding assets like gold.
- **Broad-Based USD Weakness:** The US Dollar is declining against all major currencies, providing a tailwind for commodities, international equities, and foreign currencies.
- **Supportive Credit Conditions:** Narrowing high-yield credit spreads and falling bond market volatility (MOVE index down long-term) indicate low perceived credit risk, which is highly supportive for equities, especially small caps.
