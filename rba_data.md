### Latest Decision (February 3, 2026):
- **Cash Rate**: 3.85% (INCREASED by 25 basis points)
- **Previous Rate**: 3.60%
- **Decision**: RATE HIKE (first in more than two years)
- **Vote**: Unanimous
- **Reason**: Pick-up in inflation

### Inflation Context:
- CPI forecast to peak at 4.2% in June 2026
- "Sticky" inflation in insurance, rent, and electricity
- Stronger-than-expected inflation data prompted hike
- RBA focused on delivering low inflation

### Forward Guidance:
- No preset path for rates
- Future decisions data-dependent
- Some forecasters suggest RBA may be done after this hike
- ASX futures indicate 9% expectation of another rate hike in March 2026
- Minutes show "material shift in inflation risks"

### RBA Stance Assessment:
The RBA just raised rates by 25bp due to inflation concerns. This represents a HAWKISH HIKE stance.

According to methodology (similar to Fed stance):
- **Hawkish hike: -2** ← CURRENT (just hiked 25bp, first hike in 2+ years)
- Hawkish hold: -1
- Neutral hold: 0
- Dovish hold: +1
- Cut: +2

**RBA Stance Score: -2 (Hawkish Hike)**

### Interpretation for 6A (AUD/USD):
- RBA just hiked (hawkish) vs Fed holding (neutral)
- Rate differential moving in AUD's favor
- However, hiking due to inflation concerns (not growth strength)
- Uncertainty about further hikes
