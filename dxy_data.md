### Trend Analysis:
- **Short-term (1-5 days)**: Slightly UP (+0.99% over 5 days)
- **Medium-term (1 month)**: DOWN (-0.71%)
- **Long-term (1 year)**: DOWN (-8.60%)

### Current Assessment:
DXY is showing mixed signals - slight uptick in very short term but overall downtrend over past month and year.
Given the 1-month trend of -0.71% and recent 5-day uptick of +0.99%, this appears relatively FLAT in the immediate term.

### Scoring:
According to methodology:
- Strong/Rising: -1
- **Flat: 0** ← CURRENT TREND (mixed signals, relatively stable around 98)
- Weak/Falling: +1

**DXY Score: 0 (Flat)**

Note: Could argue for +1 (Weak) given the 1-year -8.60% decline, but recent 5-day action suggests consolidation.
