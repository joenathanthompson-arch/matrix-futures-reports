**Report Generated:** 2026-02-13 02:38 UTC

## I. Executive Summary

This report provides a quantitative daily bias for 10 key futures instruments across commodities, equity indices, and FX. The bias is derived from a weighted model of over 14 macroeconomic factors. Today's report indicates a **STRONG_BULLISH** bias for Equities, a **BULLISH** bias for Commodities, and a **MIXED** bias for FX.

The primary drivers for today's bullish sentiment are **falling real yields** and a **weakening US Dollar**. The risk-off sentiment, as indicated by a VIX reading above 20, is providing a tailwind for safe-haven assets like Gold and the Japanese Yen.

## II. Asset Class Bias

| Asset Class | Aggregated Bias | Key Drivers |
|---|---|---|
| **Commodities** | BULLISH | Strong bullish signals in Gold and Silver, driven by falling real yields and a weak USD. Crude oil is slightly bullish with geopolitical risks offsetting a large inventory build. |
| **Equity Indices** | STRONG_BULLISH | All four major indices show a strong bullish bias. Falling real yields are a significant tailwind, particularly for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. Narrowing credit spreads are also supportive. |
| **FX** | MIXED | The Japanese Yen shows a strong bullish bias due to the BoJ's policy normalization and risk-off sentiment. The Euro is slightly bullish against a weak USD, while the Australian Dollar is neutral as risk-off sentiment weighs on it. |
