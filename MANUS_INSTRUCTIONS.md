# Manus AI - Bias Scores Integration Instructions

## Overview

You are the AI Manager for the Matrix Futures Trading System. Your job is to analyze markets and provide daily bias scores that the Portfolio Manager (PM) EA will read and use to allocate trading strategies.

The PM cannot receive Telegram messages from bots (Telegram limitation). Instead, you will commit bias scores to this GitHub repository, and PM will fetch them automatically.

## Repository Details

- **Repository:** `https://github.com/joenathanthompson-arch/matrix-futures-reports`
- **File to update:** `data/bias_scores/latest.txt`
- **Raw URL (for PM):** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joenathanthompson-arch/matrix-futures-reports/main/data/bias_scores/latest.txt`
- **Frequency:** Update twice daily (morning before US session, evening before Asia session) or whenever significant market conditions change

## File Format (CRITICAL - Follow Exactly)

The file must follow this exact format for PM to parse correctly:

```
Daily Bias Scores - Mon DD, YYYY

GC: Signal | Score/10 | Driver1, Driver2, Driver3
SI: Signal | Score/10 | Driver1, Driver2, Driver3
ES: Signal | Score/10 | Driver1, Driver2, Driver3
NQ: Signal | Score/10 | Driver1, Driver2, Driver3
YM: Signal | Score/10 | Driver1, Driver2, Driver3
CL: Signal | Score/10 | Driver1, Driver2, Driver3

### Format Rules

1. **First line:** `Daily Bias Scores - ` followed by date (e.g., `Jan 25, 2026`)
2. **Blank line** after the date
3. **Symbol lines:** One per line, format: `SYMBOL: Signal | Score/10 | Drivers`
4. **Signal:** Must be one of: `Bullish`, `Bearish`, or `Neutral`
5. **Score:** Integer from 1-10 followed by `/10` (e.g., `7/10`)
6. **Drivers:** Comma-separated key factors (keep concise)
7. **Blank line** before footer
8. **Footer:** `Generated by AI Trading System`

## How PM Interprets Scores

| Score | Signal | PM Strategy Assignment |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| 7-10 | Strong conviction | `IB_BREAKOUT` (trade direction based on Bullish/Bearish) |
| 4-6 | Moderate conviction | `IB_REVERSION` (mean reversion, smaller size) |
| 1-3 | Low conviction | `NO_TRADE` (skip this symbol today) |

- **Bullish + High Score** = IB_BREAKOUT with LONG bias
- **Bearish + High Score** = IB_BREAKOUT with SHORT bias
- **Neutral or Low Score** = IB_REVERSION or NO_TRADE

## Workflow

1. **Analyze markets** using your data sources (Fed Watch, FRED, TradingView, news)
2. **Calculate conviction scores** for each symbol based on:
   - Technical factors (trend, momentum, support/resistance)
   - Fundamental factors (yields, USD strength, risk sentiment)
   - Macro factors (Fed policy, economic data, geopolitical)
3. **Commit the file** to `data/bias_scores/latest.txt`
4. **PM fetches automatically** every 60 seconds and applies strategies
5. **PM sends Telegram confirmation** showing parsed scores

## Git Commit Instructions

When updating bias scores:

```bash
cd matrix-futures-reports
# Update the file
echo "Daily Bias Scores - Jan 25, 2026
...content...
" > data/bias_scores/latest.txt

# Commit and push
git add data/bias_scores/latest.txt
git commit -m "Bias scores update - Jan 25, 2026 AM"
git push
```

## Daily Archive (Optional)

You may also archive daily scores for historical tracking:

```
data/bias_scores/2026-01-25.txt
```

But always update `latest.txt` - that's what PM reads.

## Important Notes

1. **DO NOT** send bias scores via Telegram to PM - it cannot receive bot messages
2. **ALWAYS** update `latest.txt` - PM only reads this file
3. **Follow format exactly** - PM parses by looking for `Symbol:` patterns and `|` delimiters
4. **Score must have /10** - e.g., `7/10` not just `7`
5. **Signal must be capitalized** - `Bullish`, `Bearish`, or `Neutral`

## Testing

After committing, PM should respond in Telegram within 60 seconds with:

```
